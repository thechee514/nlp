Erast Fandorin.
Erast Petrovich Fandorin (Russian: Эраст Петрович Фандорин) is a fictional 19th-century Russian detective and the hero of a series of Russian historical detective novels by Boris Akunin. The first novel was published in Russia in 1998, and the latest was published in November 2006. More than 15 million copies of Fandorin novels have been sold as of May 2006, even though the novels were freely available from many Russian web-sites and the hard-copies were relatively expensive for Russian standards. New books in the Fandorin series typically sell over 200,000 copies in the first week alone, with an unparalleled (for mystery novels) first edition of 50,000 copies for the first books to 500,000 copies for the last. In Russia, the Fandorin series rivals "The Lord of the Rings" or "Harry Potter" in popularity. The English translations of the novels have been critically acclaimed by, among others, Ruth Rendell.
Concept of the series.
In the Soviet Union, detective novels enjoyed mass popularity. Although they were seen as a "low genre" by the communist officials, both local (such as Vayner brothers and Julian Semenov), and foreign detective novels have always been avidly coveted.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, many trashy detective novels were published that featured a lot of gore and sex. Akunin's wife, in common with many other Russians, started to enjoy reading this genre of literature. However, she did not want to be seen reading the novels and she always wrapped them in brown paper to prevent people from seeing what she was reading. This inspired Akunin to create a detective novel which nobody would be ashamed to be caught reading, something between the literature of Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoevsky and the pulp of modern Russian detective novels.
He set out to write a cycle about Fandorin with an exploration of every subgenre of the detective novel in mind, from spies to serial killers. In addition, he wanted to address different types of human character in his books. As Akunin identified sixteen subgenres of crime novels, as well as sixteen character types, the novels in the Erast Fandorin series will ultimately number sixteen. As of November 2006, twelve novels have been published in Russia. The series is titled ' ("New detective", or "New Mystery"). This title serves to set the novels apart from the postmodernist intellectual novels as well as from the trashy detective novels, but it is also a subtle play on the use of time in the novels.
Akunin uses many historical settings for his novels. He uses the war between Russia and the Ottoman Empire as background for the novel "The Turkish Gambit"; the death of the "White General" Mikhail Skobelev (as 'Mikhail Sobolev') in "The Death of Achilles"; and the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II and the Khodynka Tragedy for "Coronation, or the Last of the Romanovs". Akunin uses the gaps in the knowledge of these histories to create an atmosphere for his mystery novels to which readers can relate.
Biography and career.
Akunin describes in "The Winter Queen" how Erast Fandorin was orphaned at the age of nineteen. He never knew his mother, and his father died bankrupt, leaving only debts. Fandorin had to abandon his education at Moscow University and was forced to enter the police force as a clerk. Since the events in "The Winter Queen" take place in the spring of 1876 (when Akunin says Fandorin is twenty), this places his birth c. 1856. Further hints at Fandorin's ancestry are given in another novel, "Altyn Tolobas", one of four novels set in the present day and featuring Fandorin's grandson Nicholas, where Akunin writes how Captain Cornelius von Dorn, a German hussar, entered Russia in ca. 1680. Erast Fandorin represents the 8th generation counting from Cornelius, the German name "von Dorn" having been Russified to "Fandorin" in the 18th century.
In "The Winter Queen" Fandorin falls in love with a seventeen-year-old girl, Elizaveta, whom he meets while he is investigating his first case. On their wedding day, she was killed by a bomb in a package addressed to Fandorin himself. At the time of the explosion, Fandorin was out pursuing the person who delivered the bomb and thus miraculously escaped without physical harm. The trauma of losing his bride leads to a lifelong slight stammer in Fandorin and a premature greyness at the temples.
In "The Turkish Gambit" Fandorin is charged with the capture of a Turkish spy during the war between Russia and the Ottoman empire. Upon his return, he requests to be stationed in a remote post, and becomes second secretary to the Russian ambassador in Japan. His adventures in Japan are detailed in the second part of "The Diamond Chariot" and in "Jade Rosary Beads". In Japan, he saves the life of the fallen yakuza Masa, who becomes his manservant as a token of gratitude. He learns martial arts, including ninjutsu, and trains in them every day with Masa. In "The Death of Achilles" Akunin describes how Fandorin returns to Russia, only to find his old friend General Mikhail Sobolev murdered. Fandorin enters the service of The Governor-General of Moscow, Knyaz Dolgoruki (a fictionalized version of Vladimir Dolgorukov).
Fandorin rises from the rank of Collegiate Registrar to that of Collegiate Counsellor over the years 1876 to 1891 (ranks XIV and VI in the Table of Ranks, respectively).
In "The State Counsellor", set in 1891, Fandorin is accused of the attempted murder of the Governor of Moscow. After he clears his name, Fandorin is offered the job of "Oberpolizeimeister" but declines, instead resigning from public service and becoming a private investigator. He then leaves for America, studying engineering at M.I.T., in 1895, as told in "Jade Rosary Beads". In "The Coronation", Fandorin returns to Russia in time to prevent an international scandal from occurring during the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia in 1896. In 1905, Fandorin protects the Trans-Siberian Railway from Japanese saboteurs during the Russo-Japanese War.
Allusions to the fate of Fandorin are made in "Altyn Tolobas". Late in life Fandorin marries again and has at least one son, Alexander, who is born in exile in London in 1920, his mother leaving Russia during pregnancy in 1919, the implication being that Erast Fandorin died in that year in the turmoils of the Russian Civil War. Alexander's son, Nicholas Fandorin, is born around 1960.
Physical appearance and other characteristics.
Boris Akunin provides the reader with a vivid portrait of Erast Fandorin. Fandorin is of average height, with a thin build. He has a small moustache, blue eyes and black hair. The death of his wife caused his hair to turn grey at the temples almost overnight, as described in "The Winter Queen". It also caused him to stammer, but this tends to diminish as tensions rise. Fandorin is always impeccably groomed and can be vain about his appearance; in "The Winter Queen" he wears a corset to improve his figure. He is a gifted linguist; in various novels he speaks English, French, German and Japanese with fluency, as well as a working knowledge of both Serbian and Turkish in "The Turkish Gambit".
In every novel Fandorin is described as a master of disguise, which he uses to infiltrate criminal hideouts and in stakeouts. When he is disguised, he does not stammer at all. In "The Coronation", Fandorin explains that this is because he always takes on the personality of the disguise, which often requires that he should not stammer. In "The Winter Queen", he learns to present evidence by making a list: "That is one. That is two. And that is three". He is brave and determined, and has to kill several men during his investigative career, but he is still sickened by the sight of blood. While in Japan, he learns the art of the ninjas (or "silent ones", as they are referred to in the novels). He is physically fit and athletic. In his later years, Fandorin becomes an enthusiast of the newly invented automobile.
Fandorin is exceptionally lucky, a common trait in the Fandorin family that skips every other generation; allusions to this character trait appear in every novel. He never loses a bet, and wins at all sports. He has however lost the appetite for gambling, as it soon became boring. He can be popular with the opposite sex, partly because he still mourns the loss of his first wife - this sadness seems to attract women.
Allusions and references to other works.
According to Akunin, he mixed several of the most sympathetic heroes of Russian literature to form the Erast Fandorin character. One of these heroes is Chatsky from Alexander Griboyedov's "Woe from Wit", from whom Fandorin inherits his sense of duty: "To serve the cause, not the individuals". Other heroes Erast Fandorin is based upon, are Andrei Bolkonski (from Leo Tolstoy's "War and Peace"), Prince Myshkin (from Fyodor Dostoevsky's "The Idiot") and Pechorin (from Mikhail Lermontov's "A Hero of Our Time").
Akunin said he "plots along the line of Kazuo Ishiguro's "Remains of the Day". The orphaned urchin Senka, the narrator of "The Lover of Death", is clearly based upon "Oliver Twist" (also pointed out by the subtitle of that novel: a Dickensian story). The entire first volume of "The Diamond Chariot" is an allusion to Alexander Kuprin's "Junior Captain Rybnikov", and the opening sentence of "The Winter Queen" is a clear reference to Mikhail Bulgakov's "The Master and Margarita". A more subtle allusion exists to Leo Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina", as the novel "The Winter Queen" starts with a suicide in 1876, the exact same year in which Anna throws herself under a train. Another allusion to Anna Karenina can be found in "The Jack of Spades", where Fandorin's current girlfriend, who is married to another man, has the same patronymic (Arkadievna) as Anna Karenina herself. In "Murder on the Leviathan", one of the newspaper fragments is signed by G. du Roy, an allusion to the journalist Georges Duroy from Guy de Maupassant's "Bel Ami".
In "The Death of Achilles" the hired killer Achimas is mentioned as having been secretly hired by the Italian government to kill an anarchist nicknamed "The Jackal" who plans to kill King Umberto - yet Achimas himself bears considerable similarity to the hired killer nicknamed "The Jackal" and who plans to kill de Gaulle in Frederick Forsyth's "The Day of the Jackal".
Furthermore, Achimas' lifestory mirrors that of the "Iliad's" Achilles and the events described in the second part of the novel are essentially one big allusion to Homer's work.
Novels.
The following list describes the novels in the order they were written, with the original titles in Russian and the publication dates for the Russian and English versions.
Each novel is assigned its own "genre", as Akunin's goal in creating this series was to try as many approaches to detective fiction as possible.
The Winter Queen.
Moscow, 1876. The 20-year-old Erast Fandorin, recently orphaned, enters civil service as a clerk in the Criminal Investigations Department of the Moscow Police. While investigating a scandalous but, seemingly, quite straight-forward case of public suicide by a rich young man, Fandorin uncovers a powerful and terrible conspiracy.
The "genre" assigned to this book is that of a "conspirological mystery."
The Turkish Gambit.
Pleven, 1877. During the Russo-Turkish war of 1877, an encrypted message is mysteriously altered, leading to strategic gains by the Turks. Fandorin, an agent of the Third Section (Russia's secret police), is ordered to find the Turkish spy before more damage to the Russian cause is done.
The book is written as a classical "spy novel."
Murder on the Leviathan.
Red Sea, 1878. A terrible mass murder is committed in Paris and clues lead "Papa" Gauche, a French police inspector on board the British steamship Leviathan, sailing from Southampton to Calcutta. Fandorin, now a diplomat newly-appointed to a post in Japan, is one of the passengers. Will Gauche's experience and Fandorin's talents be enough to uncover the killer?
This novel exploits some of the more familiar plot devices used by Agatha Christie.
The Death of Achilles.
Moscow, 1882. After four years of diplomatic service in Japan, Fandorin returns to Moscow with his Japanese manservant Masa. He arrives just in time to hear about the tragic death of war hero Mikhail Sobolev, who apparently suffered a stroke in his hotel room. But Fandorin, who has just assumed the post of the Governor-General's Deputy for Special Assignments, is very suspicious of the circumstances of Sobolev's death. Before long, his investigation will lead him to another quite extraordinary man.
The "genre" is defined as a "hired killer mystery."
Special Assignments.
"Special Assignments" (Russian: Особые поручения) is a single volume containing two different Erast Fandorin novellas, "The Jack of Spades" (Russian: Пиковый валет) and "The Decorator" (Russian: Декоратор). They both deal with Fandorin's service as the Deputy for Special Assignments (hence the name) for the Moscow Governor-General Prince Dolgorukoi. The two novellas are not so much different in the "genres" as in the atmosphere of the plot. The first one is a light-hearted, comical adventure, while the second one is a gory, hair-raising thriller.
"The Jack of Spades".
Moscow, 1886. Fandorin and his assistant Tulipov pursue a crafty con man who has successfully tricked the Governor-General himself.
"The Decorator".
Moscow, 1889. As several prostitutes are murdered with exceptional brutality, Fandorin sees parallels with the murders attributed to Jack the Ripper. Fandorin and Tulipov are on the case, but the maniacal killer always seems to be one step ahead.
The State Counsellor.
Moscow, 1891. Disguised as Fandorin, the leader of a revolutionary Combat Group murders a reactionary general. The attack having occurred in the Moscow Province, Prince Dolgorukoi's career is put into grave danger. After Fandorin is cleared, he attempts to pursue the Combat Group and its leader Mr. Green, an extremely tough and resourseful man. However, a big police official, Prince Pozharsky, dispatched from St. Petersburg, takes over the case and proves to be quite a talented man in his own right. Pushed aside, Fandorin must find a way to rescue his boss' reputation.
The novel is a "political mystery."
The Coronation.
Moscow, May 1896. The imperial family moves to Moscow for the coronation of tsar Nicholas II. However, Nicholas' 4-year-old cousin Mikhail is abducted and the kidnapper demands a diamond from the sceptre as ransom. The absence of the diamond in the sceptre would create an international scandal. The kidnappers are a world-famous gang headed by a mysterious international super-criminal Dr. Lind. Erast Fandorin, now a private detective, has been tracking Lind from America to Russia and is ready to offer his assistance to the royal family.
The "genre" of this story is described by Akunin as a "high society mystery."
She Lover of Death.
Moscow, 1900. Fandorin deals with a suicide club. The action takes place contemporaneously with the events of "He Lover of Death" below. It is told from the point of view of 'Colombina', a Moscow debutante from Irkutsk, whose attraction to decadent literature and a sentimental nature may prove to be fatal.
This "decadent mystery" is an allusion to Robert Louis Stevenson's short-story cycle The Suicide Club.
He Lover of Death.
Moscow, 1900. The action takes place contemporaneously with the events of "She Lover of Death" above. It is told from the point of view of Senka, a boy from the Khitrovka slums, who has gotten himself mixed up in very dangerous criminal activity. Fandorin and Masa, in Moscow investigating the suicide club, offer their assistance to the reluctant Senka.
This novel is called a "Dickensonian mystery" as the allusions to Oliver Twist are hard to miss.
The Diamond Chariot.
This novel consists of two parts. In the first part, set during the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Fandorin, in charge of protecting the Trans-Siberian Railway from sabotage, is tracking down a Japanese agent.
In the second part, set in 1878, Fandorin's arrival in Yokohama and his adventures there are recounted. Upon entering diplomatic service, he is immediately mixed up into a political assassination plot and crosses a clan of ninjas. In a way that does not become apparent until the end, this story is related to the first part of the novel.
The title Алмазная Колесница "Diamond Vehicle" refers to the Kongōjō school of Tantric Buddhism. The first part is structured as a haiku, with each chapter taking the place of a syllable, while the second part is meant to serve as a "meaning between the lines" of the haiku.
Akunin has called this novel an "ethnographic mystery."
Jade Rosary Beads.
"Jade Rosary Beads" (Russian: Нефритовые четки) is the latest book describing Fandorin's adventures in the 19th century. It was issued in Russia on 21 November, 2006. The book contains three novellas and seven short stories, some of which take Fandorin abroad to England, America, and France. It is illustrated by Igor Sakurov.
The short stories are followed by three novellas.
Stage.
With Yin and Yang, Akunin also wrote a play featuring Fandorin, but the play is not included in the novel series. Subtitled "A theatrical experiment", it features a white and a black version. When a wealthy man dies, Fandorin is brought in to clarify some points of the will. After the murder of several characters, Fandorin (assisted by his manservant Masa) needs his sleuthing skills once more. The black version leads to a diametrical opposed result from the white version, due to some minor changes in evidence found in the beginning of the play. This play is notable for the comic element introduced by Masa's limited knowledge of Russian -- he has begun copying out words from the dictionary but so far has gotten only to the letter "D." The play was written for director Aleksey Borodin.
Typography.
Akunin uses typography to enhance the story that is being told. Newspaper stories are typeset in a different font (see "The Turkish Gambit"). He even goes so far that chapters written from the perspective of a Japanese (see "Leviathan") are rotated ninety degrees to give the illusion of traditional Japanese writing. (This effect is omitted in the American edition of "Leviathan".)
Translations.
Novels from the Erast Fandorin series have been translated into more than 30 languages. Because Akunin saw the English-language market as key to the rest of the world, he was very cautious when selecting the person who was allowed to translate the Fandorin novels into English, eventually choosing Andrew Bromfield. Each of the first six Fandorin novels have been translated into English. Random House, the American publisher, published only the first four novels. The British publisher is Weidenfeld & Nicolson.
Each of the first three translated novels have sold over 50,000 copies in the UK alone. "The Winter Queen" has been described as the possible result if Aleksandr Pushkin had written mystery novels and Andrew Bromfield is lauded as one of England's finest translators from Russian. Critics were also very favorable about Murder on the Leviathan, but less so about The Turkish Gambit, which offers a far slower pace than "The Winter Queen". The Death of Achilles has again been received very positively.
The first ten novels have been translated into German, with the eleventh due in October 2006. Dutch publisher De Geus has completed its announced translations of the first seven novels. Translations for the other novels have not yet been announced. In Italian and French, the first 8 novels have been translated. The first five novels have been translated in Norwegian.
The whole cycle has been translated into Polish by Jerzy Czech and are published successively since 2003 by Świat Książki (The World of Books) Publishing.
Adaptations.
"Azazel" was filmed for television in 2003 by Alexander Adabashyan, and has also been adapted for the stage in Russia. Reviews of the play have not been very favorable and have called it long, windy, talky and situational, or entertaining but plodding. Paul Verhoeven owns the rights to a future English-language film version. Filming was scheduled to start in July 2007, with Milla Jovovich as the female lead actress, but has been postponed due to Jovovich's pregnancy. Dan Stevens is to play the part of Erast Fandorin.
In 2005, two further Fandorin novels, "The Turkish Gambit" and "The Councillor of State", were made into big-budget movies by Dzhanik Faiziyev and Filip Yankovsky respectively. The adaptation of "The Turkish Gambit" set a new box office record in Russia with 19.23 million USD, beating ' by more than 5 million USD. It was met by criticism from the Russian military, who said the film stains the memory of general Mikhail Skobelev. "The Turkish Gambit" won three Golden Eagle Awards (best art design, best costume design and best film editing), while "The Councillor of State" won two awards (best leading actor for Nikita Mikhalkov and best supporting actor for Konstantin Khabensky).
Yin and Yang has also been performed on stage in Russia, with both versions performed back-to-back on two consecutive days. They met with critical acclaim. As of this writing (September 2006), all Erast Fandorin films, plays and television programs have been made in Russian only.
The Winter Queen has also been adapted as a comic strip by Aleksey Kuzmichev.
