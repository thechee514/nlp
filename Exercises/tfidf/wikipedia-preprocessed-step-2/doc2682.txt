Bruno Maddox.
Bruno Maddox (born November 15 1969) is a British literary novelist and journalist who is best known for his critically lauded novel "My Little Blue Dress" (2001) and for his satirical magazine essays.
After graduating from Harvard University in 1992, Maddox began his career reviewing books for "The New York Times Book Review" and "The Washington Post Book World". In early 1996, he was appointed to an editorship at "Spy" magazine and within a few months he was promoted to editor-in-chief, a position he held until the magazine shut down in 1998. Maddox wrote "My Little Blue Dress" between 1999 and 2001. Since its publication, he has focused on writing satirical essays for magazines such as "GEAR" and "Travel + Leisure"; he also contributes a monthly humor column to "Discover" magazine called "Blinded by Science", drawing on his early exposure to science and technology. Maddox is likewise a contributing editor to the American edition of "The Week" magazine.
Early years.
Maddox was born in London in 1969 to former "Nature" editor Sir John Maddox, a writer on science and nature, and Brenda Maddox, a biographer of Rosalind Franklin, W.B. Yeats, Nora Barnacle and several others. He has one sister, Bronwen, who became a journalist and is Chief Foreign Commentator of "The Times" as of 2008.
Despite his family's background in science, Maddox was interested in the humanities while he attended Westminster School, an independent boys' school in London. Maddox went on to study English literature at Harvard University and graduated in 1992. He published his first and only article in the student newspaper "The Harvard Crimson" during his senior year. He won the undergraduate Thomas Temple Hoopes Prize for his senior thesis "on the use of adjectives in restaurant menus" titled "Maltese: A Gastrosophic Theory of Reading". After graduation Maddox moved from Cambridge, Massachusetts to Moscow—where he worked for three weeks as the English-language editor of a Russian magazine—and then to New York City, where he spent two years working odd jobs, including hand-delivering celebrity invitations to local parties.
Maddox's freelance writing career began in 1994, when he became a book reviewer for "The New York Times Book Review" and "The Washington Post", where he developed a reputation for writing scathing reviews that would later help him land a job as an editor at "Spy" magazine. Maddox described his book reviewing style as "pretty vicious", and quipped that he "was a frustrated, twenty-something guy, sitting in his bedroom venting existential rage on these nasty academics". His last book review for "The Washington Post" was in late 1996; however, he continued reviewing for "The New York Times" up until 1998, contributing only a couple of reviews thereafter.
At the beginning of the dot-com boom, Maddox found full-time work at an information technology company, where he worked for a year and a half.
Editorship of "Spy" magazine.
In mid-1996, Maddox was hired as a senior editor at "Spy" magazine, a satirical monthly, in New York City. "Spy" had ceased publication in 1994 but was quickly resuscitated under new ownership by Sussex Publishers Inc., which reduced the magazine's frequency from ten to six issues a year. At "Spy", Maddox was assisted by deputy editor Adam Lehner, a satirist. In December 1996, Maddox was promoted to editor-in-chief; his editorial team included Jared Paul Stern and, beginning in late 1997, future screenwriter William Monahan.
Maddox wanted to turn "Spy" into a national magazine rather than build on its legacy of covering stories that centered on New York. According to Maddox, two factors motivated the shift of target market. The magazine's past objects of satire, the "cheesy villains who anointed themselves as targets" in the 1980s, were no longer on the national stage. Meanwhile, the "sins of the '90s [were] those of a private, quiet cultivation of a sense of purity", and were harder to expose or ridicule.
In early 1998, Sussex Publishers increased "Spys frequency from six to nine issues a year in an effort to boost readership and ad pages. "Spys paid circulation continued to drop during Maddox's tenure, and in March 1998, the magazine once again ceased publication. Sussex's President and CEO John Colman concluded that "[despite the] great work by Bruno and his team, there just wasn't the [advertiser and consumer] acceptance that we need to make it financially viable". Maddox conceded that "a satirical magazine in New York in the late Nineties really had no function", because "everyone was being very modest and coy".
"My Little Blue Dress".
In 1999, Maddox sold the advance rights to his first novel, "My Little Blue Dress", to a German publisher based on a five-page fax proposal he sent on the advice of his literary agent John Brockman. Within a week Brockman managed to sell the rights to the novel to publishers in an additional eight countries on the strength of the proposal alone. (Maddox had not yet written even an initial manuscript.)
"My Little Blue Dress" was published in 2001 by Viking Press, a Penguin Group imprint. The novel begins as a memoir of a hundred-year-old woman, but several chapters later reveals itself to be a spoof of the genre. The protagonist is a fictional Bruno Maddox who is desperately attempting to create a forgery of an old woman's memoir in a single night. Several book reviewers avoided spoiling the novel's satire but others gave away its premise, reasoning that the publisher "reveal[s] all on the book jacket anyway". The novel's intrigue lies in the mysterious reason compelling the fictional Maddox to forge a memoir.
Critics applauded "My Little Blue Dress" but also expressed some reservations. For example, Salon.com's Maria Russo cautioned that the novel "is one of those 'don't try this at home' literary experiments that could easily have turned into an unreadable, pretentious disaster", but concluded that Maddox "pulls it off with a kind of fearless pizzazz". "The New York Times Emily Barton conceded that "for all its blunders", Maddox delivers "a winsome and vastly entertaining novel".
In an interview, Maddox praised Bret Easton Ellis’s 1991 novel "American Psycho", stating that he drew inspiration from protagonist Patrick Bateman's long-winded monologues about Phil Collins, restaurants, clothes, and how to remove blood from his carpets.
In 2001, Maddox promoted his first novel on a joint book tour billed as the "Minor Novelists Tour" with his friend William Monahan, another former "Spy" editor, but it was interrupted by the 9/11 attacks. Monahan's ' was also published by a Penguin imprint. Several years later, Maddox gave some indication that he was working on a film adaptation of "My Little Blue Dress", but it is unknown whether Maddox completed the script.
Recent essays.
After the publication of "My Little Blue Dress" in 2001, Maddox was reportedly working on a second novel set in California, where "everyone's aspirational and deluded" and the "people are quite happy being waiters and dreaming of stardom". As of 2007, however, no manuscript has been forthcoming.
Since 2001, Maddox has written numerous articles for popular magazines, such as the now-defunct "GEAR". Published one year after the September 11, 2001 attacks, his essay "Before It Was Real" describes the callousness of the terrorists who flew into the World Trade Center through the experience of playing a flight simulator game. Another example of Maddox's work is his 2003 profile of Karl Wenclas, leader of the Underground Literary Alliance, titled "The Angriest Book Club in America" and published in the fashion magazine "BlackBook". Wenclas later derided Maddox for distorting the Underground Literary Alliance in his "BlackBook" essay and summed up the article as "riddled with falsehoods".
In late 2003, Maddox began to contribute articles regularly to "Travel + Leisure". His first article in the magazine was called "The Concorde, R.I.P.", which chronicled his flight aboard the supersonic Concorde airplane before it was decommissioned; it was later included in "The Best Travel Writing 2005", the second volume of the annual Travelers’ Tales series. In 2004 Maddox began working as a contributing editor for the American edition of "The Week" magazine and as of 2007 continues to contribute weekly to the print issue, handling sections including "Main Stories", "Talking Points", and "Only in America". He also reviewed several books for "The New York Post" in 2004 and 2005.
In 2006, Maddox began contributing a regular humor column called "Blinded by Science" to "Discover" magazine. His writing draws upon his childhood exposure to science; due to his father's career, his family was immersed in science and he was regularly exposed to scientists at social events. Maddox's first year's columns earned him a nod as a finalist in the 2007 National Magazine Awards' "Columns and Commentary" category.
Maddox's "Discover" columns are often criticized; his essays "Stuck in Creationism" and "Fictional Reality", in particular, have been controversial. In 2007, Maddox attended the newly opened Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky and in his essay "Stuck in Creationism" described the Creationists as "fond of science" despite their need to contort "fresh claims from the world of mainstream science" so that they can "fit the framework of creationist belief or [be] discounted with some sort of scientific-sounding explanation". In response, Do-While Jones of "Evolution in the News" argued that "there is no conflict between Christianity and science" but rather "there is a conflict between Christianity and evolution because there is a conflict between science and the theory of evolution". Later in the year Maddox declared science fiction obsolete in his essay "Fictional Reality" and was roundly criticized in the blogosphere, most notably by "Scientific Americans J.R. Minkel. Maddox wrote that "fiction—all fiction—finally became obsolete as a delivery system for big ideas" as a result of the "scarcity of foreseeable future", citing the decline of author Michael Crichton's work as evidence. Minkel lambasted Maddox and pointed to author Neal Stephenson's cutting-edge work as proof to the contrary, venturing that "science fiction writers can "dictate" the future if they have the vim and vision".
Style.
Satire is evident in much of Maddox's work, from his years as editor-in-chief for "Spy" magazine to his numerous articles in "Travel + Leisure", and his novel "My Little Blue Dress". Maddox's satirical tendencies extend to his interviews and publicity materials. In one interview he made the preposterous claim that he once "spent 2 days being a personal assistant to a mafia boss in New York". Maddox's Penguin biography skewers his own career, claiming he "elevated ["Spy"] to within spitting distance of its former glory, then accidentally bankrupted it after two short years", which led "The Harvard Crimson", his alma mater's student newspaper, to speculate that "Maddox himself had a hand in writing" it. Maddox's popular science columns for "Discover" magazine impart his own personal views on science with a markedly humorous and skeptical bent.
