Name.
The name "Riyadh" is derived from plural of the Arabic word "rawdha", which means "garden," particularly those formed in the desert after the spring rains. Riyadh has for more than 1500 years been a fertile area set in the heartland of the Arabian Peninsula. The settlement was historically famous for its Palm Trees and Dates and Orchards. The modern name was first applied to only certain parts of the settlement where orchards predominated. Gradually the name was used for the entire settlement.
Early History.
During the Pre-Islamic era, the settlement at the site was called "Hajr" (), And was reportedly founded by the tribe of Banu Hanifa. Hajr served as the capital of the province of Al Yamamah, Whose governors were responsible for most of central and eastern Arabia during the Umayyad and Abbasid eras. Al-Yamamah broke away from the Abbasid Empire in 866 and the area fell under the rule of the Ukhaydhirites, who moved the capital from Hajr to nearby Al Kharj. The city then went into a long period of decline. In the 14th century North African traveller Ibn Battuta wrote of his visit to Hajr, describing it as "the main city of Al-Yamamah, and its name is Hajr". Ibn Battuta goes on to describe it as a city of canals and trees with most of its inhabitants belongs to Bani Hanifa, and reports that he continued on with their leader to Mecca to perform the Hajj.
Later on, Hajr broke up into several separate settlements and estates. The most notable of these were "Migrin" (or "Muqrin") and "Mi'kal", though the name "Hajr" continued to appear in local folk poetry. The earliest known reference to the area by the name "Riyadh" comes from a 17th-century chronicler reporting on an event from the year 1590.
