Podgorica.
Podgorica (Montenegrin/Serbian Cyrillic: Подгорица, Greek: "Diokleia", "Διοκλεια", Latin: "Dioclea", "Birziminium") is the capital and largest city of Montenegro. It is located
at, 44 m above sea level. It was previously called Titograd.
A census in 2003 put the city's population at 136,473. The favorable geographical position of Podgorica, at the confluence of the Ribnica and Morača rivers and on the meeting point of the fertile Zeta plain and Bjelopavlići Valley has made the city an attractive location for settlement. The city is situated only a few dozen kilometres from both winter ski centres in the north and seaside resorts on the Adriatic Sea.
The municipality of Podgorica accounts for 10.4% of Montenegro's territory and 27.3% of its population. Besides being an administrative center of Montenegro, Podgorica is also its economic, cultural and educational focal point.
Name.
The name literally means "under the Gorica" in the Serbian language; Gorica (meaning "little mountain") is the name of the hill that overlooks the centre of the city.
A former town (now ruins) named "Doclea", existed in pre-Roman and Roman times and was located about 3 km northwest from Podgorica. The Roman Emperor Diocletian hailed from this region. In later centuries, Romans "hyper-corrected" the name to "Dioclea", wrongly guessing that an "I" had been lost due to vulgar speech patterns. "Duklja" is the later Slavic version of that word.
When Podgorica was founded before the 11th century, it was called Birziminium. In the Middle Ages, the town was known as Ribnica before 1326, and between 1946 and 1992 it was called Titograd.
History.
Podgorica is located at the crossroads of several important routes that lead down to the city along the valleys of the rivers Zeta, Morača, Cijevna, Ribnica, and Sitnica, in the ravine of Skadar lake and in the vicinity of the Adriatic Sea, in the fertile lowland with favorable climate conditions. The area has been suitable for human habitation since ancient times, with the earliest human settlements being founded in prehistory. The oldest remains of material culture on this area belong to the late Stone Age. During the Illyrian age, the area including the Zeta and Bjelopavlići ravines was inhabited by members of two Illyrian tribes, Labeates and Docleats, that directly influenced the genesis of local settlements.
Labeati inhabited the area from Skadar to today's Podgorica. They had their own fortress, Meteon (now Medun), and a well-developed way of life, especially militarily.
Docleats also inhabited the valley of the Zeta River, and thanks to the fertile plain and favorable geographical and road position, experienced fast economic growth. Their biggest settlement was "Doclea". The city was situated about three kilometers northwest of today’s Podgorica. From the urban point of view, Doclea was adapted to the terrain configuration. At that time it was a big city, with 8 – 10 thousand inhabitants, in which all core urban issues were resolved. A relatively high population density in an area with a radius of just over ten kilometers was conditioned by geographical position, a favorable climate, positive economic conditions and defensive positions that were of great importance at that time.
Beginning in the 5th century, since the arrival of the first Slavic and Avar tribes and the beginning of the break up of the Roman Empire, the area bore witness to many noteworthy events. Eventually, the existing fortifications ceased their function, and new towns were created. Slavic groups that inhabited the area were in constant fights with Byzantium and tended to establish a new state. The result of the turmoil was establishment of a new settlement that was probably named after the river Ribnica on the banks of which it was erected. The first mention of Ribnica is related to the period of rule of the Serbian royal family of the Nemanjići. Geographical position conditioned route importance of Ribnica, as the crossroads of main road directions enabled connection of these areas with the West. When they finally inhabited these areas, the Slavs, by creating a new state, started developing their own culture and art. That culture was acceptable to the medieval church and feudal class.
The name of Podgorica is mentioned for the first time in 1326 in one court document of the Kotor archive. Podgorica was economically strong. Merchant connections between Dubrovnik and the State of Nemanjici, well developed at that time, were maintained over the road that led through Trebinje and Nikšić to Podgorica. As it was sited on the busiest crossroads, Podgorica was the center of very vivid flow of goods, merchants, messengers and other passengers that augmented to its development, economic power, military strength and strategic importance. The Turkish occupation of Podgorica in 1474 interrupted the economic, cultural and artistic rise of the city. The Turks built up a huge fortress in Podgorica and the existing settlement, with highly developed merchant connections, turned into the main defensive and attacking bastion against the rebellious tribes. The fortified city, with towers, gates and defensive ramparts, enabled the Turks to resist all attacks. In 1864, Podgorica became a township (kaza) of İşkodra vilayet as Böğürtlen ("Blackberry" for Turkish). She was also known Burguriçe in Albanian.
Pursuant to the decision of the Berlin Congress in 1878, Podgorica was integrated into Montenegro. That marked the end of four centuries of Turkish occupation and the beginning of new era in the development of Podgorica and Montenegro. The city developed relatively quickly and grew into a strong market. The first forms of capital concentration started to show up. In 1904 the first significant financial institution was formed – Zetska savings bank, which would soon grow into Podgorička bank. Roads to all neighboring towns were constructed, and in 1902 Podgorica got its first significant commercial company - a tobacco plant. In the period between the two world wars Podgorica counted around 13,000 residents.
Podgorica suffered heavily during World War II. It was bombarded over 70 times and was devastated to the ground, with the deaths of over 4,100 victims. It was liberated on December 19, 1944.
Under the name of Titograd, on July 13, 1946, it became the capital of the Socialist Republic of Montenegro. In the period that followed a general transformation of the town was realized. Material, personnel and scientific – technical potential was increased, education experienced strong growth, many new cultural and health institutions were founded, and by then-modern roads and air connections the city became connected to the rest of the state and foreign countries. Titograd rapidly became the commercial, socioeconomic and cultural center of Montenegro.
The name of Podgorica was reinstated on April 2, 1992.
The destructive Yugoslav wars bypased Montenegrin teritorry, but Montenegro, and thus Podgorica, were heavily affected economicaly. A period of severe economic stagnation lasted throughout 1990s. The economy began to recover in the early 2000s, and Podgorica began to emerge as a modern pro-western city. It became capital of a sovereign state of Motnenegro on June 3, 2006, which added to it's significance as a regional center, and boosted it economic prospects.
Population.
Although being a medium sized city by European standards, Podgorica is by far the largest city in Montenegro, with almost one third of citizen of Montenegro living there. There are around 170,000 people in the Podgorica municipality, including the small towns of Tuzi and Golubovci, and around 140,000 people in the city itself. This is the official data from the 2003 census, while estimates go up to 200,000.
"(If the methodology used up to 1991 was used in the 2003 census, Podgorica city-proper would have 140,734 citizens, while the Municipality of Podgorica would have a population of 179,401)"
Economy.
Besides being an administrative centre of Montenegro, Podgorica is also its main economic engine. The majority of Montenegro's industrial, financial and commercial base is situated in Podgorica.
Before the World Wars, the majority of Podgorica's economy was based on trade and small-scale manufacture, an economic model established during the long rule of the Ottoman Empire. After World War II, Podgorica became Montenegro's capital, and the focus of the rapid urbanization and industrialization process that took place during the Yugoslav era. Industries such as aluminium and tobacco processing, textile industry, engineering and vehicle production, and industrialized wine production, were established in and around Podgorica.
The Yugoslav wars, and the dissolution of Yugoslavia, left Podgorica's industries without markets, suppliers or funds to invest and modernize equipment. This led to a decline of many factories and finally, to some of them closing down. Those that survived were privatised, and have now more or less recovered. The Podgorica aluminium smelter ("Kombinat aluminijuma Podgorica - KAP"), owned by Rusal, and AD Plantaže, a wine and brandy making company, are still among the biggest companies in Podgorica.
In the 2000s, Podgorica witnessed a rapid expansion of its financial and service sector, and its economy transformed into a more service-oriented one. The two stock markets situated in Podgorica (Montenegro and NEX) today have a daily turnover bigger than stock exchanges in much larger cities. Today, economic activity in Podgorica has mostly shifted from heavy industries towards telecommunications, construction and banking. The increasing number of investors and foreign companies that are opening outlets in Podgorica add significantly to the growth and diversification of Podgorica's economy.
As a side effect, this has skyrocketed the prices of real estate and development land in the centre of Podgorica. This is expected to continue, with Podgorica becoming the capital of a sovereign state in 2006.
Geography.
Podgorica is located in central Montenegro, in the northern part of the Zeta plain. The entire area in which Podgorica is located is intersected with rivers, and the city itself is located only 15 km north of Lake Skadar. The Morača and Ribnica rivers flow through the city, while the Zeta, Cijevna, Sitnica and Mareza rivers flow through the surrounding area. One of the main features of the city is its richness in bodies of water.
The city itself, in contrast to most of Montenegro, lies on a predominantly flat area at the northern end of Zeta plain. The only exceptions are hills that overlook the city. The most significant is the Gorica Hill, a 107 m tall hill that rises above the city center, and Podgorica's namesake. Some of the other hills are named "Malo brdo" ("Little hill"), "Velje brdo" ("Big hill"), "Ljubović" and "Čardak". These are mostly hills too steep for development. They rather limit the city's expansion, especially to the north, shaping the city's development.
Climate.
Podgorica has a typical Mediterranean climate, with hot and dry summers, and mild winters. Snow is an almost unknown phenomenon in the city. It has a mean annual rainfall of 1544 mm, and a median daily temperature of 16.4 °C. It has around 135 days per year with temperatures higher than 25 °C. Podgorica is particularily known for its extremely hot summers, as temperatures over 40 °C are a common occurrence in July and August. The highest temperature recorded in Podgorica was 44.8 °C, on 16 August 2007.
Culture.
Podgorica is home to many Montenegrin cultural institutions and events. It hosts the Montenegrin National Theatre and a number of museums and galleries.
The Montenegrin National Theatre is the most famous theatre not only in Podgorica, but in all of Montenegro. Podgorica is also host to the City's Theatre, the Children’s Theatre and the Puppet Theatre, as well as to many smaller enthusiastic theatre troupes.
Although not as rich in museums and galleries as the historic royal capital Cetinje, there are several noteworthy museums, among which are the Podgorica City Museum, the Museum of Marko Miljanov and the Natural History Museum. Notable art galleries of Podgorica are Dvorac Petrovića ("Petrović's Castle") and Perjanički dom ("House of the Honour Guard").
Education.
Most of Montenegro's higher education establishments are located in the city. It is home to the University of Montenegro, the most significant institution for higher education in the country. The Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts is also located in Podgorica, as well as the DANU cultural organization. In recent years, the number of private institutions for higher education has increased, further expanding the educational possibilities in Podgorica.
The municipality of Podgorica has 34 elementary schools and 10 secondary schools, including one gymnasium.
The "Radosav Ljumović" national library is considered to be the most comprehensive library in Montenegro.
Media.
Podgorica is undoubtedly the media hub of Montenegro. The city is home to the headquarters of the state-owned public television broadcaster RTCG. Commercial broadcasters located in Podgorica include TV IN, NTV Montena, Elmag RTV, RTV Atlas and MBC. Programmes of these broadcasters are seen in much of Montenegro.
There is one free radio station in Montenegro, with headquarters in Podgorica. It is called Radio Skadar Lake and broadcasts on 107,9 Mhz.
All daily newspapers in Montenegro ("Vijesti", "DAN" and "Pobjeda") are published in Podgorica, as is the popular weekly magazine "Monitor".
Urban transport.
Public transportation used to be provided solely by "Gradsko saobraćajno preduzeće", a city-owned public transportation company which operated all urban bus lines within Podgorica. After dealing with many problems, it went bankrupt in the early 2000s, and public transportation was entirely provided by two private carriers.
The re-introduction of city-owned public transportation took place recently, but with smaller minibuses rather than with buses. Public transportation has had a hard time dealing with competition. Unlicensed taxis mostly threatened the bus service carriers, but increasingly today, cheaper dispatched taxicab service is becoming the favourite mode of transportation service for Podgorica citizens.
Road.
Podgorica's location in central Montenegro makes it a natural rail and road hub of the state. Roads in Montenegro generally are not up to European standards, especially the road connecting the city with northern Montenegro and Serbia. Efforts are being made to construct a modern highway, to connect the north with Podgorica, and on to the Adriatic sea.
The newly built Sozina tunnel, 4.2 km long and very modern even by European standards, shortens the journey from Podgorica to Bar, Montenegro's main seaport, to under half an hour.
The planned Beograd - Bar motorway is going to pass near Podgorica, making travel from Podgorica to northern and coastal Montenegro faster.
Rail.
The Podgorica railway station is located near the city centre. The station is an obsolete building that lags both behind Europeans standards and Podgorica's needs. Furthermore, the building's owner, "Railways of Montenegro", is lacking the funds needed for reconstruction.
Podgorica's main railway link is Belgrade - Bar railway, both in passenger and freight traffic. The railway link to Nikšić is currently being reconstructed and electrified, and passenger service is expected to start in 2009. Podgorica is also connected by rail with Shkodër and Tirana in Albania, but the railway has been unused for some time.
Air transport.
Podgorica Airport is situated 12 km south of the city, and is the main international airport for Montenegro. On July 13, 2006, an entirely new passenger terminal was opened.
There are regular flights from Podgorica to Belgrade, Bari, Budapest, Zurich, Frankfurt, Ljubljana, Paris, Rome, Skopje, and Vienna.
Architecture.
In accordance with both the city's and country's turbulent history, Podgorica contains a mixture of various architectural styles. Whenever the rule and regime changed, which in Podgorica occurred frequently, the architectural style typical for that regime was applied.
As Podgorica was part of the Ottoman Empire until 1878, there are many remnants of Turkish architecture. The oldest parts of modern Podgorica, "Stara Varoš" ("Old town") and "Drač", are typical representations of this, with two mosques, a Turkish clock tower and narrow, curvy streets throughout the neighbourhoods.
With the city then being incorporated into Montenegro, the urban core shifted to the other bank of the Ribnica River, where the town developed in a more European way, with wider streets intersecting at right angles.
During World War II, Podgorica was almost razed to the ground, being bombed over 70 times. After the liberation, the rebuilding began in a similar way to other cities in communist-ruled SFRY. Mass residential blocks were erected, with basic design typical for countries of the Eastern bloc. The entire part of the city on the right bank of the Morača River was built in this way. Even the empty spaces in the city centre were filled with near-brutalist structures, resulting in an unfortunate fusion of old and new. The residential and business blocks erected during the existence of SFRY provided the more-than-necessary housing for Podgorica citizens after the war, but are heavily criticised for their uninventive and grey appearance.
The major advance in architecture of Podgorica began in late 1990s and since then the city's face has changed rapidly. Apartment buildings and business blocks are erected rapidly, incorporating modern glass-and-steel styles. Public spaces in the city are heavily invested in, so the city got many entirely new squares, parks and monuments. New landmarks have been emerging, such as the "Hristovog Vaskrsenja" orthodox temple and the main feature of the Podgorica skyline, the Millennium Bridge. Podgorica is today in a process of rapid transformation from featureless town to modern European capital.
Sport.
The most popular sports in Podgorica are by far football and basketball. Basketball became especially popular during the success of KK Budućnost Podgorica in the late 1990s and early 2000s, both in Yugoslav and European competitions.
Football in Podgorica has a long tradition which is associated with FK Budućnost Podgorica. World-famous football players Predrag Mijatović and Dejan Savićević were born in Podgorica, and made their debut in FK Budućnost.
Besides Budućnost, FK Zeta from the Podgorica suburb of Golubovci has also made its way to the former first league of Serbia and Montenegro. These two clubs will probably compete with each other for leading position in the First League of Montenegro.
Three more clubs from Podgorica and its surroundings play in the Montenegrin First League: FK Dečić (Tuzi), FK Kom and FK Mladost. One of the most popular clubs from the suburbs is FK Ribnica from Konik.
The volleyball team OK Budućnost Podgorica and the women's handball team ŽRK Budućnost T-Mobile has also had significant success in European competitions. Budućnost Podgorica is the most significant sports society in Podgorica, and its name means "Future" in the Serbian/Montenegrin language.
Annual sporting events, such as the Podgorica Marathon and the Morača River jumps attract a number of international competitors.
Venues.
Almost every football club in Podgorica has its own stadium. Worth mentioning are the Stadium of Small Sports (Малих спортова стадиум, "Malih sportova stadium") under Gorica hill and the sport shooting range under Ljubović hill. There are dozens of other sports facilities scattered around the city, notably indoor soccer fields.
Subdivisions.
The municipality of Podgorica consists of "Podgorica City Proper" and two subdivisions called "Urban municipalities" (Градске општине, "Gradske opštine"), Golubovci and Tuzi.
The entire municipality of Podgorica is further divided into 57 "local communities" (мјесне заједнице, "mjesne zajednice"), bodies in which the citizens participate in making decisions about matters of relevance to the local community.
