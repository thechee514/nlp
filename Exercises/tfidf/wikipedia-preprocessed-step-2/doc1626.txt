Tegucigalpa.
Tegucigalpa () (Tegus for short) is the capital city of Honduras (together with Comayagüela) and is also the country's largest city. Tegucigalpa is also the capital of Honduras's Francisco Morazán department.
Geography.
The city is located on a chain of mountains at 14°5′N 87°13′W, at an elevation of 3,250 feet (990 m). The Choluteca river, which crosses the city from south to north, physically separates Tegucigalpa and its sister city Comayagüela. El Picacho hill, a rugged mountain of moderate height (), rises above the downtown area; several neighborhoods, both residential and shanty towns, are located on its slopes. The city is comprised of gentle hills, and the ring of mountains surrounding the city tends to trap pollution. During the dry season, a dense cloud of smoke lingers in the basin until the first rains fall.
Of all the major Central American cities, Tegucigalpa's climate is among the most pleasant due to its high altitude. Like much of central Honduras, the city has a tropical climate, though tempered by the altitude — meaning less humid than the lower valleys and the coastal regions — with even temperatures averaging between 19 and 23 degrees Celsius (66 to 74 °F). The months of December and January are coolest, whereas March and April—popularly associated with Holy Week’s holidays—are hottest and driest. Precipitation is spread unevenly along the year; during the Caribbean hurricane season (June to November), it may reach 920 mm (36 in) at the end of a normal day.
History.
Tegucigalpa was founded by Spanish settlers as "Real Villa de San Miguel de Tegucigalpa de Heredia" on September 29, 1578 on the site of an existing native settlement. Before and after independence, the city was a mining center for silver and gold. The capital of the independent Republic of Honduras switched back and forth between Tegucigalpa and Comayagua until it was permanently settled here in 1880. It is said that the society of Comayagua, the long time colonial capital of Honduras, publicly disliked the wife of President Marco Aurelio Soto, who took revenge by moving the capital to Tegucigalpa. However, it is more likely that the change took place because President Soto was an important partner of the Rosario Mining Company, an American silver mining company, whose operations where based in San Juancito, about away from Tegucigalpa, and he needed to be closer to his personal interests.
The city remained relatively small and provincial until the 1970s when immigration from the rural areas began in earnest. During the 1980s, several avenues and some traffic overpasses were built, as well as a few large buildings, something relatively new to a city characterized until then by two-story buildings. Tegucigalpa continues to sprawl far beyond its former colonial core, towards the east, south and west, creating a large but disorganized new metropolis.
The city's main buildings include the former Presidential Palace (now a national museum), a 20th-century Legislative Palace, the headquarters of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI), the campus of the National University of Honduras (founded in 1847), an 18th-century cathedral and the Basilica of the Virgin of Suyapa.
Industrial production, small and mostly for local consumption, has increased since the 1970s with improved roadways. Products include textiles, clothing, sugar, cigarettes, lumber, plywood, paper, ceramics, cement, glass, metalwork, plastics, chemicals, tires, electrical appliances, and farm machinery. Some "maquiladoras" (duty-free assembly plants) have been established since the 1990s in an industrial park in the Amarateca valley, on the northern highway. Silver, lead, and zinc are still mined in the outskirts of the city.
Tegucigalpa: Two capitals in one.
For all practical purposes the capital of Honduras is Tegucigalpa, but some sources note that two “cities” share that designation. Chapter 1, Article 8, of the Honduran constitution states (translated), "The cities of Tegucigalpa and Comayagüela, jointly, constitute the Capital of the Republic." Chapter 11, Article 295, translates, "The Central District consists of a single municipality made up of the former municipalities of Tegucigalpa and Comayagüela"; however, municipalities are defined in Honduras as political entities similar to counties, and they may contain one or more cities. In a decree of October 30, 1880, President Marco Aurelio Soto established a permanent seat of government in Tegucigalpa, and in 1907 the episcopal (now archiepiscopal) see was translated there. On March 15, 1938, General Tiburcio Carías Andino and the National Congress declared that Comayagüela was a "barrio" ("neighbourhood") of Tegucigalpa, the national capital. Today some government offices are listed with Comayagüela addresses, but the area is considered a part of Tegucigalpa.
Hurricane Mitch.
On October 30, 1998, the city was significantly damaged by Hurricane Mitch. It destroyed part of the Comayagüela section of the city, as well as other places along the banks of the Choluteca river. The storm remained over Honduran territory for five days, dumping heavy rainfall late in the rainy season. The ground was already saturated and could not absorb the heavy precipitation, while deforestation and debris left by the hurricane led to catastrophic flooding throughout widespread regions of the country, especially in Tegucigalpa.
The heavy rain caused flash floods of the Choluteca river's tributaries, and the swollen river overflowed its banks, tearing down entire neighborhoods and bridges across the ravaged city. The rainfall also triggered massive landslides around El Berrinche hill, close to the downtown area. These landslides destroyed most of the Soto neighborhood, and debris flowed into the river, forming a dam. The dam clogged the waters of the river and many of the low-lying areas of Comayaguela were submerged; historic buildings located along Calle Real were either completely destroyed or so badly damaged that repair was futile.
Tegucigalpa Today.
Tegucigalpa is divided presently into "'barrios'" and "'colonias'". The latter represent relatively recent 20th-century middle class residential suburbs that are continuously spreading while the former are old inner-city neighborhoods. Most of the city's outskirts are "'barrios marginales'", shantytowns that house the poorest elements of Honduran society. The marked difference between social classes in Honduras is evident at Tegucigalpa and its improvised growth. The wealthy elite of the country live in upscale neighborhoods such as El Hatillo, Lomas del Guijarro, Loma Linda, Miramontes, Palmira, and El Molino.
Population.
According to 2005 estimates, the city of Tegucigalpa has approximately 1.5 million people.
The city-dwellers are predominantly Spanish speaking mestizos with a very small white Hispanic minority. They are joined by Arab immigrants from Palestine, as well as from China. There are indigenous (Amerindians) and Afro-Honduran people as well.

Politics.
The local government—at its level, by far the most important in the country—is headed by Ricardo Alvarez, the current mayor of Tegucigalpa, from the National Party of Honduras. Tegucigalpa and Comayaguela form one single district, called "Distrito Central" (DC for short), which is difficult to manage due to its large size and population and myriad needs, amidst widespread corruption and poverty.
Places of interest.
There are several conventional tourist attractions in Tegucigalpa. Some interesting places include: Parque La Leona, the Metropolitan Cathedral, Villa Roy Museum, the former Presidential Palace, the Museum of National Identity, the National University, the Basilica of the Virgin of Suyapa, La Tigra National Park, Picacho Hill and its zoo, and Chiminikee (a science park and museum for children).
There are several charming colonial villages within easy driving distance from Tegucigalpa: Santa Lucia (away), Valle de Angeles (away), Ojojona, Yuscaran and San Juancito. Each has its own distinct character and sense of history and all of them make easy day-trips out of the city.
Around the city.
Tegucigalpa, as a colonial city, has several "barrios" in the oldest districts of the city and Comayaguela, and "colonias", in the new ones. None of them have well-defined limits, which tend to be up to the city-dwellers` will, or even town-centers. There are some main avenues, but not into downtown. Except for the latter (also called boulevards), like all the Central American cities, there doesn't seem to be any rhyme nor reason as to how streets are named, making orientation and driving rather difficult to first-time visitors to the city. Colonia Palmira, a wealthy neighborhood to the east of the city center on the Boulevard Morazan, hosts many of the foreign embassies as well as upscale restaurants. Lomas del Guijarro, Loma Linda, and Miramontes are upscale neighborhoods that house most of the apartment complexes in the city.
The best hotels in the city are found around these districts too. These include: Mariott Hotel, Clarion Hotel, Intercontinental, Honduras Maya, Plaza Del Libertador, Plaza San Martin, Hotel Alameda, Excelsior Hotel and Casino.
Museums.
There are a handful of history and art museums in the city: Identidad Nacional (recently founded), Nacional Villaroy, del Hombre, Historico Militar, Historia Natural and Galeria de Arte Nacional. Besides, Sala Bancatlan (Banco Atlántida) offers some arts exhibitions occasionally.
Shopping centers.
The epicenter of shopping in Tegucigalpa currently revolves around Multiplaza, a multi-level indoor shopping mall that includes a major grocery store, a movie theater complex, restaurants, banking and of course, many retail shops. Newer malls include Las Cascadas and MetroMall, both with stores restaurants. MetroMall includes a sizeable movie theater complex.
Smaller shopping centers and strip malls can be found all over the city, including Los Castanos, El Dorado, and the new Los Proceres center.

Airport.
Toncontin International Airport serves as the major airport in and out of Tegucigalpa. The origin of this name is unknown. This airport is frequently criticized for being one of the most dangerous in the world (due to its location next to a sierra, its short runway, and difficult approach, which requires large commercial jets to execute a tight hairpin leftward u-turn turn at very low altititude to land on a very short runway--American Airlines pilots, for example, receive additional, specific training for the Toncontin approach). Thankfully, major renovations, both cosmetic and physical, have taken place and continue (as of January, 2008). For those who have not flown in and out of Tegucigalpa within the last couple of years, there is a marked change -- from the terminals themselves to the immigrations/customs area. The hope is that additional air service carriers will choose to fly in and out of Toncontin. Efforts have been made for years to replace it with Palmerola airport in Comayagua, currently a Honduran and American Air Force base. Toncontín has been improved by the work of CAT (the Airport Corporation of Tegucigalpa) which is owned by TACA of El Salvador and by INTERAIRPORTS, a company hired by the government of Honduras to manage the four airports of the country.
Sports.
Tegucigalpa is home to Club Deportivo Olimpia and Club Deportivo Motagua, members of the Honduran National Soccer League. Between the two teams, they have won more than 30 Championships, and play their home games at Estadio Nacional Tiburcio Carias Andino.
There are also inter-city school sports championships.
There is a Coliseum used mainly for basketball but is also used as a music concert venue. There is also what is called a "Villa Olimpica" to practice Olympic sports such as boxing, archery, tennis and tae-kwon-do; it is located close to the National University.
