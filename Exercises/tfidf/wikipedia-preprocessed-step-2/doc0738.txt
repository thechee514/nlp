Mumbai.
Mumbai (Marathi: ', IPA:), formerly Bombay, is the capital of the Indian state of Maharashtra. With an estimated population of thirteen million, it is the most populous city in India. Along with the neighbouring suburbs of Navi Mumbai and Thane, it forms, at nineteen-million, the world's fifth most populous metropolitan area. Mumbai lies on the west coast of India and has a deep natural harbour. Its port handles over half of India's seagoing passenger traffic and a large proportion of her maritime cargo.
Mumbai is the commercial and entertainment centre of India, accounting for 25 per cent of industrial output, forty per cent of maritime trade, and seventy per cent of capital transactions to India's economy. Mumbai is one of the world's top ten centers of commerce by global financial flow, home to such important financial institutions as the Reserve Bank of India, the Bombay Stock Exchange, the National Stock Exchange of India and the corporate headquarters of many Indian companies and numerous multinational corporations. The city also houses India's Hindi film and television industry, known as Bollywood. Mumbai's business opportunities, as well as its high standard of living, attract migrants from all over India and, in turn, make the city a potpourri of many communities and cultures.
Names.
The name Mumbai is an eponym, etymologically derived from "Mumba" or "Maha-Amba"— the name of the Hindu goddess Mumbadevi, and "Aai" — mother in Marathi. The former name "Bombay" had its origins in the 16th century when the Portuguese arrived in the area and called the place with various names, which would finally take on the written form "Bombaim", still common in current Portuguese use. After the British gained possession in the 17th century, it was anglicised to "Bombay", although it was known as "Mumbai" or "Mambai" to Marathi and Gujarati-speakers, and as "Bambai" in Hindi, Urdu. However, even Marathi and Gujarati-speakers commonly used "Bombay" when speaking in English. The name was officially changed to its Marathi pronunciation of "Mumbai" in 1995.
A widespread explanation of the origin of the traditional English name "Bombay" holds that it was derived from a Portuguese name meaning "good bay". This is based on the fact that "bom" (masc.) is Portuguese for "good" whereas the English word "bay" is similar to the Portuguese "baía" (fem., "bahia" in old spelling). The normal Portuguese rendering of "good bay" would have been "boa bahia" rather than the grammatically incorrect "bom bahia". However, it is possible to find the form "baim" (masc.) for "little bay" in sixteenth-century Portuguese.
Other sources have a different origin for the Portuguese toponym "Bombaim". José Pedro Machado's "Dicionário Onomástico Etimológico da Língua Portuguesa" ("Portuguese Dictionary of Onomastics and Etymology") mentions what is probably the first Portuguese reference to the place, dated from 1516, as "Benamajambu" or "Tena-Maiambu", pointing out that "maiambu"' seems to refer to Mumba-Devi, the Hindu goddess after which the place is named in Marathi (Mumbai). In that same century, the spelling seems to have evolved to "Mombayn" (1525) and then "Mombaim" (1563). The final form "Bombaim" appears later in the 16th century, as recorded by Gaspar Correia in his "Lendas da Índia" ("Legends of India"). J.P. Machado seems to reject the "Bom Bahia" hypothesis, asserting that Portuguese records mentioning the presence of a bay at the place led the English to assume that the noun ("bahia", "bay") was an integral part of the Portuguese toponym, hence the English version Bombay, adapted from Portuguese.
History.
Artefacts found near Kandivali in northern Mumbai indicate that these islands had been inhabited since the Stone Age. Documented evidence of human habitation dates back to 250 BC, when it was known as "Heptanesia" (Ptolemy) (Ancient Greek: "A Cluster of Seven Islands"). In the 3rd century BC, the islands formed part of the Maurya Empire, ruled by the Buddhist emperor, Aşoka. During its first few centuries, control over Mumbai was disputed between the Indo-Scythian Western Satraps and the Satavahanas. The Hindu rulers of the Silhara Dynasty later governed the islands until 1343, when the kingdom of Gujarat annexed them. Some of the oldest edifices of the archipelago – the Elephanta Caves and the Walkeshwar temple complex date from this era.
In 1534, the Portuguese appropriated the islands from Bahadur Shah of Gujarat. They were ceded to Charles II of England in 1661, as dowry for Catherine de Braganza. These islands, were in turn leased to the British East India Company in 1668 for a sum of £10 per annum. The company found the deep harbour on the east coast of the islands to be ideal for setting up their first port in the sub-continent. The population quickly rose from 10,000 in 1661, to 60,000 in 1675; In 1687, the British East India Company transferred its headquarters from Surat to Bombay. The city eventually became the headquarters of the Bombay Presidency. From 1817 onwards, the city was reshaped with large civil engineering projects aimed at merging all the islands in the archipelago into a single amalgamated mass. This project, known as the Hornby Vellard, was completed by 1845, and resulted in the total area swelling to 438 km². In 1853, India's first passenger railway line was established, connecting Bombay to the town of Thane. During the American Civil War (1861–1865), the city became the world's chief cotton trading market, resulting in a boom in the economy and subsequently enhancing the city's stature.
The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 transformed Bombay into one of the largest seaports on the Arabian Sea. Over the next thirty years, the city grew into a major urban centre, spurred by an improvement in infrastructure and the construction of many of the city's institutions. The population of the city swelled to one million by 1906, making it the second largest in India after Calcutta. As capital of the Bombay Presidency, it was a major base for the Indian independence movement, with the Quit India Movement called by Mahatma Gandhi in 1942 being its most rubric event. After India's independence in 1947, it became the capital of Bombay State. In the 1950 the city expanded to its present limits by incorporating parts of Salsette island which lay to the north.
After 1955, when the State of Bombay was being re-organised along linguistic lines into the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat, there was a demand that the city be constituted as an autonomous city-state. However, the Samyukta Maharashtra movement opposed this, and insisted that Mumbai be declared the capital of Maharashtra. Following a successful protests in which 105 people were killed by police firing, Maharashtra state was formed with Mumbai as its capital on May 1, 1960.
The late 1970s witnessed a construction boom and a significant influx of migrants, which saw Mumbai overtake Kolkata as India's most populous city. This influx caused unrest among local Maharashtrians who worried about the loss of culture, jobs, and language. The Shiv Sena Party was formed by Balasaheb Thackeray for the purpose of securing the interests of Maharashtrians. The city's secular fabric was torn apart in the riots of 1992–93, after large scale sectarian violence caused extensive loss of life and property. A few months later, on March 12, a series of co-ordinated bombings at several city landmarks by the Mumbai underworld killed around three hundred people. In 1995, the city was renamed "Mumbai" by the Shiv Sena government of Maharashtra, in keeping with their policy of renaming colonial institutions after historic local appellations. There have also been terrorist attacks, sponsored by Islamic extremists, on public transport buses in past years. In 2006, Mumbai was also the site of a major terrorist attack in which over two hundred people were killed when several bombs exploded almost simultaneously on the Mumbai Suburban Railway.
Geography.
Mumbai is located on seven now-merged islands (see seven islands of Bombay) which are Isle of Bombay, Mazagaon, Colaba, Old Woman's Island, Parel, Worli, and Salsette Island. Mumbai lies at the mouth of Ulhas River off the western coast of India, in the coastal region known as the Konkan. Much of Mumbai is just above sea level, and the average elevation ranges from to. Northern Mumbai is hilly, and the highest point in the city is 450 metres (1,450 feet). Mumbai spans a total area of 603 km² (233 sq mi).
Four lakes supply water to Mumbai: Lakes Vihar, Vaitarna, Tulsi and Tansa. Tulsi Lake and Vihar Lake are located within the metropolitan limits, in Borivili National Park, and supply part of the city's drinking water. The waters of a fifth lake also within the city, Powai, is not used. Mumbai also has three small rivers within the city limits originating in the National Park. The coastline of the city is indented with numerous creeks and bays. The eastern coast of Salsette Island is covered with large mangrove swamps, rich in biodiversity. The western coast is mostly sandy and rocky.
Soil cover in the city region is predominantly sandy due to its proximity to the sea. In the suburbs, the soil cover is largely alluvial and loamy. The underlying rock of the region is composed of black Deccan basalt flows, and their acid and basic variants dating back to the late Cretaceous and early Eocene eras. Mumbai sits on a seismically active zone owing to the presence of three fault lines in the vicinity. The area is classified as a Zone III region, which means an earthquake of up to magnitude 6.5 on the Richter-scale may be expected.
Mumbai is classified as a metropolis of India, under the jurisdiction of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. It consists of two distinct regions — the city and the suburbs, which also form two separate districts of Maharashtra. The city region is also commonly referred to as the "Island City".
Climate.
The climate of the city, being in the tropical zone, and near the Arabian Sea, may be broadly classified into two main seasons — the humid season, and the dry season. The humid season, between March and October, is characterized by high humidity and temperatures of over. Between June and September, the monsoon rains lash the city supplying most of the city's annual rainfall of. The maximum annual rainfall ever recorded was in 1954. The highest rainfall recorded in a single day was 944 mm (37.16 inches) on 2005-07-26. The dry season, between November and February, is characterized by moderate levels of humidity and warm to cool weather. Cold northerly winds are responsible for a mild chill during January and February.
Annual temperatures range from a high of to a low of.
The record high is and record low is on 1962-01-22.. Though is the lowest recorded by one of the two official meteorological weather stations, a low of was recorded on February 8, 2008 at a weather station near Kanheri Caves that lies within city limits.
Economy.
Mumbai serves as an important economic hub of the country, contributing 10% of all factory employment, 40% of all income tax collections, 60% of all customs duty collections, 20% of all central excise tax collections, 40% of India's foreign trade and 40 billion Rupees (US$ 9 billion) in corporate taxes. Mumbai's per-capita income is Rs.48,954 which is almost three times the national average. Many of India's numerous conglomerates (including State Bank Of India, Tata Group, Godrej and Reliance), and four of the Fortune Global 500 companies are based in Mumbai. Many foreign banks and financial institutions also have branches in this area, the "World Trade Centre (Mumbai)" being the most prominent one. Up until the 1980s, Mumbai owed its prosperity largely to textile mills and the seaport, but the local economy has since been diversified to include engineering, diamond-polishing, healthcare and information technology. Mumbai is home to the Bhabha Atomic Research Center, and most of India's specialized, technical industries, having a modern industrial infrastructure and vast, skilled human resources. Rising venture capital firms, start-ups and established brands work in aerospace, optical engineering, medical research, computers and electronic equipment of all varieties, shipbuilding and salvaging, and renewable energy and power. The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) also runs oil operations at Bombay High, an offshore oilfield located 160 km off the coast of Mumbai. The Bombay High supplies 14% of India's oil requirement and accounts for about 38% of all domestic production. The "Knowledge City" set up by the Reliance Communications is the largest economy campus in India, located at Navi Mumbai in Mumbai.
Mumbai's status as the state capital means that state and central government employees make up a large percentage of the city's workforce. Mumbai also has a large unskilled and semi-skilled labour population, who primarily earn their livelihood as hawkers, taxi drivers, mechanics and other such blue collar professions. The port and shipping industry, too, employs many residents, directly or indirectly. In the district of Dharavi, in central Mumbai, there is an increasingly large recycling industry, processing recyclable waste from other parts of the city; the district has an estimated 15,000 single-room factories.
The media industry is another major employer in Mumbai. Most of India's major television and satellite networks, as well as its major publishing houses, are headquartered here. The centre of the Hindi movie industry, Bollywood produces the largest number of films per year in the world; and the name Bollywood is a portmanteau of Bombay and Hollywood. Marathi television and Marathi film industry are also based in Mumbai.
Along with the rest of India, Mumbai, its commercial capital, has witnessed an economic boom since the liberalisation of 1991, the finance boom in the mid-nineties and the IT, export, services and BPO boom in this decade. The middle class in Mumbai is the segment most impacted by this boom and is the driver behind the consequent consumer boom. Upward mobility among Mumbaikars has led to a direct increase in consumer spending. Mumbai has been ranked 10th among the world's biggest centres of commerce in terms of financial flow in a survey compiled by Mastercard Worldwide.
One of the largest Special Economic Zone ("SEZ") in India is being set-up in Navi Mumbai. The "Navi Mumbai SEZ (NMSEZ)" will be spread over an area of around 50 square kilometers. Another SEZ known as the "Maha Mumbai SEZ" is also being set up in Mumbai. These two twin SEZs are slated to be the second largest single location SEZ complex in the world.
Civic administration.
The city is administered by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) (formerly the Bombay Municipal Corporation), with executive power vested in the Municipal Commissioner, who is an IAS officer appointed by the state government. The Corporation comprises 227 directly elected Councillors representing the twenty four municipal wards, five nominated Councillors, and a titular Mayor. The BMC is in charge of the civic and infrastructure needs of the metropolis. An Assistant Municipal Commissioner oversees each ward for administrative purposes. Almost all the state political parties field candidates in the elections for Councillors. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region consists of 7 Municipal Corporations and 13 Municipal Councils. In addition to the BMC, it includes the Municipal Corporations of Thane, Kalyan - Dombivali, Navi Mumbai, Mira-Bhayandar, Bhiwandi - Nizampur and Ulhasnagar.

Transport.
Most of Mumbai's inhabitants rely on public transport to travel to and from their workplace. Transport systems in Mumbai include the Mumbai Suburban Railway, BEST buses, taxis, auto rickshaws, ferries, and aeroplanes.
The city is the headquarters of two railway zones – the Central Railway (CR) headquartered at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, and the Western Railway (WR) headquartered near Churchgate. The backbone of the city's transport, the Mumbai Suburban Railway, is composed of three separate networks running the length of the city, in a north-south direction.
The Mumbai Metro, an underground and elevated railway system that is currently under construction, will run from Versova to Andheri to Ghatkopar when the first phase is completed in 2009. Mumbai is well connected to most parts of India by the Indian Railways. Trains originate from Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, Dadar, Lokmanya Tilak Terminus, Mumbai Central and Bandra terminus. Mumbai's suburban rail systems carry a total of 2.2 billion passengers every year, one third of the world's population.
Public buses run by BEST cover almost all parts of the metropolis, as well as parts of Navi Mumbai and Thane. Buses are used for commuting short to medium distances, while train fares are more economical for long distance commutes. The BEST runs a total of 3,400 buses, ferrying 4.5 million passengers over 340 routes. Its fleet consists of single-decker, double-decker, vestibule, low-floor, disabled-friendly, and air-conditioned buses. MSRTC buses provide intercity transport and connect Mumbai with other major cities of Maharashtra and other states.

Black and yellow-metered, taxis traverse most of the metropolis. Auto rickshaws operate in the suburban areas of Mumbai. Rickshaws run on Compressed Natural Gas, are the main form of hired transport. These three-wheeled vehicles are a quick way to get around. They are the cheapest form of hired transport and can accommodate up to three passengers.
Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport (formerly, Sahar International Airport) is the busiest airport in India. The Juhu aerodrome was India's first airport, and now hosts a flying club and a heliport. The proposed Navi Mumbai International Airport which is to be built in the Kopra-Panvel area, has been sanctioned by the Government and would help relieve the increasing traffic burden on the existing airport. Mumbai handles about 25% of the domestic and 38% of the international air passenger traffic in the country.
With its unique topography, Mumbai has one of the best natural harbours in the world, handling 50% of the country's passenger traffic, and much of India's cargo. It is also an important base for the Indian Navy, being the headquarters of the Western Naval Command. Ferries from Ferry Wharf allow cheap access to islands and beaches in the area.
Utility services.
The BMC supplies potable water to the city, most of which comes from the Tulsi and Vihar lakes, as well as a few lakes further north. The water is filtered at Bhandup, which is Asia's largest water filtration plant. Even India's first underground water tunnel will come up in Mumbai. The BMC is also responsible for the road maintenance and garbage collection in the city. Almost all of Mumbai's daily refuse of 7,800 metric tonnes is transported to dumping grounds in Gorai in the northwest, Mulund in the northeast, and Deonar in the east. Sewage treatment is carried out at Worli and Bandra, and disposed off by two independent marine outfalls of and at Bandra and Worli respectively. A third outfall at Malad is in the planning stages.
Electricity is provided by BEST in the island city, and by Reliance Energy, Tata Power, and Mahavitaran (Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd) in the suburbs. Most of the city's electricity is hydroelectric and nuclear based. Consumption of electricity is growing faster than production capacity. The largest telephone service provider is the state-owned MTNL, which held a monopoly over fixed line and cellular services up until 2000, and provides fixed line as well as mobile WLL services. Cell phone coverage is extensive, and the main service providers are Vodafone Essar, Airtel, BPL group, Reliance Communications and Tata Indicom. Both GSM and CDMA services are available in the city. Broadband internet penetration is increasing in the city, with MTNL and Tata being the leading service providers.
