Albert Camus.
Albert Camus () (November 7, 1913 – January 4, 1960) was a French-Algerian author and philosopher who won the Nobel prize in 1957. He is often associated with existentialism, but Camus refused this label. On the other hand, as he wrote in his essay "The Rebel", his whole life was devoted to opposing the philosophy of nihilism. On the subject of his belief or not in God, he writes in the third volume of his notebooks: "I do not believe in God and I am not an atheist".
His most important phrase for the future was: "All of us, among the ruins, are preparing a renaissance beyond the limits of nihilism. But few of us know it". Albert Camus founded in 1949 the Group for International Liaisons in the Revolutionary Union Movement, according to the book "Albert Camus, une vie" of Olivier Todd.
Camus preferred to be known as a man and a thinker, rather than as a member of a school or ideology. He preferred persons over ideas. In an interview in 1945, Camus rejected any ideological associations: “No, I am not an existentialist. Sartre and I are always surprised to see our names linked…”. In his collection of essays "The Nuptials" he wrote that he was a son of Greece.
Camus was the second-youngest recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature (after Rudyard Kipling) when he became the first African-born writer to receive the award, in 1957. He is also the shortest-lived of any literature laureate to date, having died in an automobile accident only three years after receiving the award.
Early years.
Albert Camus was born on November 7, 1913 in Mondovi, Algeria to a French-Algerian (pied-noir) settler family. His mother was of Spanish extraction and was half-deaf. His father, Lucien, died in the Battle of the Marne in 1914 during the First World War, while serving as a member of the Zouave infantry regiment. Camus lived in poor conditions during his childhood in the Belcourt section of Algiers. In 1923, he was accepted into the lycée and eventually to the University of Algiers. However, he contracted tuberculosis in 1930, which put an end to his football activities (he had been a goalkeeper for the university team) and forced him to make his studies a part-time pursuit. He took odd jobs including private tutor, car parts clerk and work for the Meteorological Institute. He completed his "licence de philosophie" (BA) in 1935; in May of 1936, he successfully presented his thesis on Plotinus, "Néo-Platonisme et Pensée Chrétienne", for his "diplôme d'études supérieures" (roughly equivalent to an M.A. by thesis).
Camus joined the French Communist Party in the Spring of 1935, apparently because of concerns about the political situation in Spain (which eventually resulted in the Spanish Civil War) rather than in support for Marxist-Leninist doctrine. In 1936, the independence-minded Algerian Communist Party (PCA) was founded. Camus joined the activities of the Algerian People's Party ("Le Parti du Peuple Algérien"), which got him into trouble with his Communist party comrades. As a result, he was denounced as a Trotskyite and expelled from the party in 1937. Camus went on to be associated with the French anarchist movement. The anarchist Andre Prudhommeaux first introduced him at a meeting in 1948 of the Cercle des Etudiants Anarchistes (Anarchist Student Circle) as a sympathiser who was familiar with anarchist thought. Camus went on to write for anarchist publications such as Le Libertaire, "La révolution Proletarienne" and "Solidaridad Obrera" (the organ of the anarcho-syndicalist CNT). Camus also stood with the anarchists when they expressed support for the uprising of 1953 in East Germany. He again stood with the anarchists in 1956, first with the workers’ uprising in Poznan, Poland, and then later in the year with the Hungarian Revolution.
In 1934, he married Simone Hie, a morphine addict, but the marriage ended due to infidelity on both sides. In 1935, he founded "Théâtre du Travail" — "Worker's Theatre" — (renamed "Théâtre de l'Equipe" ("Team's Theatre") in 1937), which survived until 1939. From 1937 to 1939 he wrote for a socialist paper, "Alger-Républicain", and his work included an account of the peasants who lived in Kabylie in poor conditions, which apparently cost him his job. From 1939 to 1940, he briefly wrote for a similar paper, "Soir-Republicain". He was rejected by the French army because of his tuberculosis.
In 1940, Camus married Francine Faure, a pianist and mathematician. Although he loved Francine, he had argued passionately against the institution of marriage, dismissing it as unnatural. Even after Francine gave birth to twins, Catherine and Jean, on September 5, 1945, he continued to joke wearily to friends that he was not cut out for marriage. Francine suffered numerous infidelities, particularly a public affair with the Spanish actress Maria Casares. In the same year Camus began to work for "Paris-Soir" magazine. In the first stage of World War II, the so-called Phony War stage, Camus was a pacifist. However, he was in Paris to witness how the Wehrmacht took over. On December 15, 1941, Camus witnessed the execution of Gabriel Péri, an event that Camus later said crystallized his revolt against the Germans. Afterwards he moved to Bordeaux alongside the rest of the staff of "Paris-Soir". In the same year he finished his first books, "The Stranger" and "The Myth of Sisyphus". He returned briefly to Oran, Algeria in 1942.
Literary career.
During the war Camus joined the French Resistance cell "Combat", which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre "Beauchard". Camus became the paper's editor in 1943, and when the Allies liberated Paris, Camus reported on the last of the fighting. He was, however, one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition to the use of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima soon after the event on August 8, 1945. He eventually resigned from "Combat" in 1947, when it became a commercial paper. It was then that Camus became acquainted with Jean-Paul Sartre.
After the war, Camus began frequenting the Café de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre. Camus also toured the United States to lecture about French thinking. Although he leaned left politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually also alienated Sartre.
In 1949 his tuberculosis returned and he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951 he published "The Rebel", a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which made clear his rejection of communism. The book upset many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France and led to the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed him and he began instead to translate plays.
Camus' first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd, the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he explained in "The Myth of Sisyphus" and incorporated into many of his other works, such as "The Stranger" and "The Plague". Despite the split from his “study partner,” Sartre, some still argue that Camus falls into the existentialist camp. However, he rejected that label himself in his essay "Enigma" and elsewhere (see: "The Lyrical and Critical Essays of Albert Camus"). The current confusion may still arise as many recent applications of existentialism have much in common with many of Camus' "practical" ideas (see: "Resistance, Rebellion, and Death"). However, the personal understanding he had of the world (e.g. "a benign indifference," in "The Stranger"), and every vision he had for its progress (i.e. vanquishing the "adolescent furies" of history and society, in "The Rebel") undoubtedly sets him apart.
In the 1950s Camus devoted his efforts to human rights. In 1952 he resigned from his work for UNESCO when the UN accepted Spain as a member under the leadership of General Franco. In 1953 he criticized Soviet methods to crush a workers' strike in East Berlin. In 1956 he protested against similar methods in Poland (protests in Poznań) and the Soviet repression of the Hungarian revolution in October.
He maintained his pacifism and resistance to capital punishment anywhere in the world. One of his most significant contributions to the movement against capital punishment was an essay collaboration with Arthur Koestler, the writer, intellectual and founder of the League Against Capital Punishment.
When the Algerian War began in 1954 it presented a moral dilemma for Camus. He identified with pied-noirs, and defended the French government on the grounds that the revolt in Algeria was really an integral part of the 'new Arab imperialism' led by Egypt and an 'anti-Western' offensive orchestrated by Russia to 'encircle Europe' and 'isolate the United States'. Although favouring greater Algerian autonomy or even federation, though not full-scale independence, he believed that the pied-noirs and Arabs could co-exist. During the war he advocated civil truce that would spare the civilians, which was rejected by both sides who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes, he began to work clandestinely for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty.
From 1955 to 1956 Camus wrote for "L'Express". In 1957 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature, officially not for his novel "The Fall", published the previous year, but for his writings against capital punishment in the essay "Réflexions sur la Guillotine". When he spoke to students at the University of Stockholm, he defended his apparent inactivity in the Algerian question and stated that he was worried what could happen to his mother who still lived in Algeria. This led to further ostracism by French left-wing intellectuals.
The Revolutionary Union Movement and the European Union.
In 1949 Camus founded the Group for International Liaisons in the Revolutionary Union Movement (according to the book Albert Camus, une vie by Olivier Todd). With George Orwell, he opposed totalitarian regimes in the East and the West.
As he wrote in “L'Homme révolté” (in the chapter about The Thought on Midday) he was a follower of the ancient Greek “Solar Tradition” (la "pensée solaire"). So, not only he was the leader of the French resistance movemet “Combat” but he also set up in 1947-8 the Revolutionary Union Movement (Groupes de liaison internationale - GLI) which was formed in 1949 and can be described as a trade union movement in the context of revolutionary syndicalism (Syndicalisme révolutionnaire). For more, see the book: "Alfred Rosmer et le mouvement révolutionnaire internationale" by Christian Gras).
His colleagues were Nicolas Lazarévitch, Louis Mercier, Roger Lapeyre, Paul Chauvet, Auguste Largentier, Jean de Boë (see the article: "Nicolas Lazarévitch, Itinéraire d'un syndicaliste révolutionnaire" by Sylvain Boulouque in the review Communisme, n° 61, 2000). His main aim was to express the positive side of Surrealism and Existentialism, rejecting the negativity and the nihilism of Andre Breton and Jean-Paul Sartre.
In 1944 Camus founded the “French Committee for the European Federation" (Comite Francais pour la Federation Europeene -CFFE) declaring that Europe “can only evolve along the path of economic progress, democracy and peace if the nation states become a federation”.
From 1943, Albert Camus had correspondence with Altiero Spinelli who founded the European Federalist Movement in Milan (see Ventotene Manifesto and the book “Unire l'Europa, superare gli stati”, Altiero Spinelli nel Partito d'Azione del Nord Italia e in Francia dal 1944 al 1945-annexed a letter by Altiero Spinelli to Albert Camus).
In 22-25 March, 1945, the first conference of the European Federalist Movement was organised in Paris with the participation of Albert Camus, George Orwell, Emmanuel Mounier, Lewis Mumford, André Philip, Daniel Mayer, François Bondy and Altiero Spinelli (see the book “The Biography of Europe” by Pan Drakopoulos). This specific branch of the European Federalist Movement disintegrated in 1957 after the domination of Winston Churchill's ideas about the European integration.
Camus and Orwell.
3 essays by Dr. Miho Takashima in the International Journal of Humanities (“Revolt and Equilibrium: A Comparative Study of Nineteen Eighty-Four and L'Homme Révolté, the Views and Struggles of Orwell and Camus”, “Art and Representation: A Comparative Study of George Orwell and Albert Camus on their Literary Works” and “George Orwell and Albert Camus: A Comparative Study – Their Views and Dilemmas in the Politics of the 1930s and 40s”) explore the relation between the work of the French writer Albert Camus and the English writer George Orwell.
Takashima argues that Orwell – perhaps intentionally, in order to warn the intellectual elite - compromised with “Big Brother”, while Camus confronted with “Plague”. This is observed not only in the comparison between “1984” and “The Man in Revolt” but, especially, in Camus' play “The State of Siege”.
This theatrical play was written together with the novel The Plague and the essay The Rebel/Man in Revolt. It is the work which - according to Camus himself - represents him best and is a response to George Orwell's 1984. The hero, Diego, opposes the totalitarian dictator nameed Plague, and dies in order to set a Spanish town free from the Inquisition.
“L’ Etat de Siege’’ ("The State of Siege") is a work against totalitarianism, written in the same epoch when Camus' idol, the English writer George Orwell, wrote 1984. The play includes an allegorical reference to the end of Orwell's novel (where the hero, Winston Smith, makes a compromise with Big Brother).
The original title of L' Etat de Siege was THE HOLY INQUISITION IN CADIX. In the French edition of the book, Camus has included a remarkable essay under the title "Why Spain?". In this polemical text, he answers his Catholic Christian friend Gabriel Marcel who criticised him for setting the plot in Spain. Here Camus expresses his opposition to the totalitarian regimes of the West, and to the behaviour of the Vatican and the Pope during World War II. The most important phrase of this essay is "Why Guernica, Gabriel Marcel?".
The Greek journalist Christos Papachristopoulos theorises that this play is based on Aeschylus' lost tragedy, Prometheus the Fire-Bringer - Προμηθεύς Πυρφόρος (see NationMaster Encyclopedia).
Albert Camus' Death.
Camus died on January 4, 1960 in an automobile accident near Sens, in a place named "Le Grand Fossard" in the small town of Villeblevin. In his coat pocket lay an unused train ticket. It is possible that he had planned to travel by train, but decided to go by car instead.
The driver of the Facel Vega car, Michel Gallimard — his publisher and close friend — also perished in the accident. Camus was interred in the Lourmarin Cemetery, Lourmarin, Vaucluse, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, France.
He was survived by his twin children, Catherine and Jean, who hold the copyrights to his work.
After his death, two of Camus' works were published posthumously. The first, entitled "A Happy Death" published in 1970, featured a character named Meursault, as in "The Stranger", but there is some debate as to the relationship between the two stories. The second posthumous publication was an unfinished novel, "The First Man", that Camus was writing before he died. The novel was an autobiographical work about his childhood in Algeria and was published in 1995.
Summary of Absurdism.
Many writers have written on the Absurd, each with his or her own interpretation of what the Absurd actually is and their own ideas on the importance of the Absurd. For example, Sartre recognizes the absurdity of individual experience, while Kierkegaard explains that the absurdity of certain religious truths prevent us from reaching God rationally. Camus was not the originator of Absurdism and regretted the continued reference to him as a "philosopher of the absurd". He shows less and less interest in the Absurd shortly after publishing "Le Mythe de Sisyphe" ("The Myth of Sisyphus''). To distinguish Camus' ideas of the Absurd from those of other philosophers, people sometimes refer to the Paradox of the Absurd, when referring to "Camus' Absurd".
His early thoughts on the Absurd appeared in his first collection of essays, "L'Envers et l'endroit" ("The Two Sides Of The Coin") in 1937. Absurd themes appeared with more sophistication in his second collection of essays, "Noces" ("Nuptials"), in 1938. In these essays Camus does not offer a philosophical account of the Absurd, or even a definition; rather he reflects on the experience of the Absurd. In 1942 he published the story of a man living an Absurd life as "L'Étranger" ("The Stranger"), and in the same year released "Le Mythe de Sisyphe" ("The Myth of Sisyphus"), a literary essay on the Absurd. He had also written a play about a Roman Emperor, Caligula, pursuing an Absurd logic. However, the play was not performed until 1945. The turning point in Camus' attitude to the Absurd occurs in a collection of four letters to an anonymous German friend, written between July 1943 and July 1944. The first was published in the "Revue Libre" in 1943, the second in the "Cahiers de Libération" in 1944, and the third in the newspaper "Libertés", in 1945. All four letters have been published as "Lettres à un ami allemand" ("Letters to a German Friend") in 1945, and have appeared in the collection "Resistance, Rebellion, and Death".
Camus' ideas on the Absurd.
In his essays Camus presented the reader with dualisms: happiness and sadness, dark and light, life and death, etc. His aim was to emphasize the fact that happiness is fleeting and that the human condition is one of mortality. He did this not to be morbid, but to reflect a greater appreciation for life and happiness. In "Le Mythe", this dualism becomes a paradox: We value our lives and existence so greatly, but at the same time we know we will eventually die, and ultimately our endeavours are meaningless. While we can live with a dualism ("I can accept periods of unhappiness, because I know I will also experience happiness to come"), we cannot live with the paradox ("I think my life is of great importance, but I also think it is meaningless"). In "Le Mythe", Camus was interested in how we experience the Absurd and how we live with it. Our life must have meaning for us to value it. If we accept that life has no meaning and therefore no value, should we kill ourselves?
Meursault, the Absurdist hero of "L'Étranger," is a murderer who is executed for his crime. Caligula ends up admitting his Absurd logic was wrong and is killed by an assassination he has deliberately brought about. However, while Camus possibly suggests that Caligula's Absurd reasoning is wrong, the play's anti-hero does get the last word, as the author similarly exalts Meursault's final moments.
Camus' understanding of the Absurd promotes public debate; his various offerings entice us to think about the Absurd and offer our own contribution. Concepts such as cooperation, joint effort and solidarity are of key importance to Camus.
Camus made a significant contribution to a viewpoint of the Absurd, and always rejected nihilism as a valid response. "If nothing had any meaning, you would be right. But there is something that still has a meaning." "Second Letter to a German Friend", December 1943.
It then follows that existentialism tends to view human beings as subjects in an indifferent, objective, often ambiguous, and "absurd" universe, in which meaning is not provided by the natural order, but rather can be created, however provisionally and unstably, by human beings' actions and interpretations.
Opposition to totalitarianism.
Camus' well-known falling out with Sartre is linked to this opposition to totalitarianism. Camus detected a reflexive totalitarianism in the mass politics espoused by Sartre in the name of radical Marxism. This was apparent in his work "L'Homme Révolté" ("The Rebel") which not only was an assault on the Soviet police state, but also questioned the very nature of mass revolutionary politics. Camus continued to speak out against the atrocities of the Soviet Union, a sentiment captured in his 1957 speech, "The Blood of the Hungarians", commemorating the anniversary of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, an uprising crushed in a bloody assault by the Red Army.
Camus and Solidarity.
The Stranger and Solidarity
Albert Camus characterizes his justification of the absurd through the experiences of a protagonist who simply does not conform to the system. His inherent honesty disturbs the status quo; Meursault’s inability to lie cannot seamlessly integrate him within society and in turn threatens the simple fabrics of human mannerisms expected of a structurally ordered society. Consequently, the punishment for his crime is not decided on the basis of murder, but rather for the startling indifference towards his mother’s recent demise. Even after a conflicting spiritual discussion with a pastor inciting Meursault to consider a possible path towards redemption, the latter still refuses to take upon salvation and symbolizes his ultimatum by embracing the “gentle indifference of the world;” an act which only furthers his solidarity with a society incapable of realizing his seemingly inhumane and misanthropic behavior.
The Plague and Solidarity
The plague is an undeniable part of life. It is omnipresent, just like death was always an impeding factor in The Stranger. Albert Camus once again questions the meaning of the moral concepts justifying humanity and human suffering within a religious framework. For Camus, the rationale behind Christian doctrine is useless; as mortal beings, we cannot successfully rationalize the impending and inescapable death sentence forced upon every human. The plague, which befalls upon Oran, is a concrete and tangible facilitator of death. Ultimately, the plague enables people to understand that their individual suffering is meaningless. As the epidimic “evolves” within the seasons, so do the citizens of Oran, who instead of willfully giving up to a disease they have no control over, decide to fight against their impending death, thus unwillingly creating optimism in the midst of hopelessness. This is where Camus channels his thoughts behind the importance of solidarity: although the plague is still primarily an agent of death, it provides the uncanny opportunity for people to realize that individual suffering is absurd. In the midst of complete suffering, the challenging response adopted by the majority of the citizens of Oran demonstrates an inexplicable humanistic connection between distraught and distant characters. Only by taking the choice to fight an irreversible epidemic are people able to create the ever-lacking meaning to a life destined for execution the moment of its creation.
Film.
Several of Camus' works have been adapted into movies. "The Stranger" has been adapted into an Italian 1967 movie by Luchino Visconti, and also to a 2001 Turkish adaptation titled "Yazgi" ("Fate") by Zeki Demirkubuz. "The Plague" was adapted to a 1992 film titled "La Peste" by Luis Puenzo and set in modern day America.
Music.
Quite a few musical artists refer to Camus and his work in their music. The post-punk band The Fall took their name from Camus' novel "The Fall". These also include an album by
Jeff Martin("Exile and the Kingdom", 2006) and songs by Gentle Giant ("A Cry for Everyone", 1972), The Cure ("Killing an Arab", 1978), Tuxedomoon ("The Stranger", 1979), The Magnetic Fields ("I Don't Want To Get Over You", 1999), The Manic Street Preachers ("The Masses Against The Classes", 2000), JJ72 ("Algeria", 2000), Suede ("Obsessions", 2002), Streetlight Manifesto ("Here's To Life", 2003), A Perfect Circle ("A Stranger" and "The Outsider", 2003), Angela McCluskey ("Know it All", 2004), Joanna Newsom ("This Side of the Blue", 2004), Tarkio ("Neapolitan Bridesmaid", 2006), The Independence, ("20-Ought-Almost-Talkin' Blues"), 2008
