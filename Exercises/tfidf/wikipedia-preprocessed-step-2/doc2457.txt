One Laptop per Child.
The One Laptop per Child association (OLPC) is an ICT4D non-profit organization, created by faculty members of the MIT Media Lab, set up to oversee The Children's Machine project and the construction of the XO-1 "$100 laptop". Both the project and the organization were announced at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January 2005. According to the home page of the project's wiki at laptop.org, "OLPC espouses five core principles: (1) child ownership; (2) low ages; (3) saturation; (4) connection; and (5) free and open source."
OLPC is funded by a number of sponsor organizations, including AMD, Brightstar Corporation, eBay, Google, Marvell, News Corporation, SES, Nortel Networks, and Red Hat. Each company has donated two million dollars. Intel was a member of the association for a brief period in 2007. It resigned its membership on 3 January 2008, citing disagreements with the organization's founder, Nicholas Negroponte.
The organization is chaired by Nicholas Negroponte and its CTO was Mary Lou Jepsen. Other principals of the company include former MIT Media Lab director Walter Bender, who is President of OLPC Software and Content, and Jim Gettys, Vice-President of Software Engineering. One Laptop per child is a 501(c)(3) organization registered in Delaware, USA.
Mission.
The goal of the foundation is to provide children around the world with new opportunities to explore, experiment, and express themselves. To that end, OLPC is designing a laptop, educational software, manufacturing base, and distribution system to provide children outside of the first-world with otherwise unavailable technological learning opportunities.
History.
OLPC is based on constructionist learning theories pioneered by Seymour Papert, Alan Kay, and also on the principles expressed in Nicholas Negroponte’s book "Being Digital". These three individuals plus the several sponsor organizations are active participants in OLPC.
The organization gained much attention when Nicholas Negroponte and Kofi Annan unveiled a working prototype of the CM1 on November 16 2005 at the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in Tunis, Tunisia. Negroponte showed two prototypes of the laptop at the second phase of the World Summit: a non working physical model and a tethered version using an external board and separate keyboard. The device shown was a rough prototype using a standard development board. Negroponte estimated that the screen alone required three more months of development. The first working prototype was demonstrated at the project's Country Task Force Meeting on May 23 2006. The production version is expected to have a larger display screen in the same size package. The laptops were originally scheduled to be available by early 2007, but production actually began in November, 2007.
At the 2006 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) announced it would back the laptop. UNDP released a statement saying they would work with OLPC to deliver “technology and resources to targeted schools in the least developed countries”.
The project originally aimed for a price of 100 United States dollars. In May 2006, Negroponte told the Red Hat's annual user summit: “It is a floating price. We are a nonprofit organization. We have a target of $100 by 2008, but probably it will be $135, maybe $140. That is a start price, but what we have to do is with every release make it cheaper and cheaper— we are promising that the price will go down.”
The OLPC project had stated that a consumer version of the XO laptop was not planned. However, the project has established the xogiving.org website for outright donations and for a "Give 1 Get 1" offer valid from November 12, 2007 for two weeks, but this was extended through December 31, 2007. The "Give 1 Get 1" offer's required donation of $399 has a tax-deductible portion of $200. The fair market value of the XO laptop is placed at $199 by the OLPC Foundation.
Participating countries.
The laptops are sold to governments, to be distributed through the ministries of education willing to adopt the policy of “one laptop per child”. The operating system and software is localized to the languages of the participating countries.
Currently participating countries.
In October 2007, Uruguay placed an order for 100,000 laptops, making Uruguay the first country to purchase a full order of laptops. An additional 200,000 more laptops should be ordered by 2009 to cover all public school children between 6 and 12 years old.
The following countries are currently participating in the project, or are receiving laptops from the Give One Get One program.
Interested countries.
The following countries have shown interest to the project in various ways.
Nigeria was the first country to announce an order for one million laptop computers, in July 2006. Since then, Nigeria had an election, and the deal has not materialized.
Libya announced an agreement in 2006 with OLPC to supply laptops to all of its 1.2 million school children. The $250 million deal included satellite Internet access, one XS (school server) per school and technical support. The deal has not materialized yet.
Thailand under prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra had committed to the project. After the 2006 coup d'état the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology said that the laptop will be evaluated with pilot projects before proceeding cautiously.
Peru pilot.
First results are mostly positive after evaluation of pilot phase in Peru which was 8 months long. The children learned quickly how to use the laptops, started to communicate more among themselves and turned to be more pleasant to each other. The parents agreed the units help their children to receive more education. However, the pilot revealed the children miss a built-in English learning software and a dictionary.
Criticism.
Though generally well received at early stages, the project has been criticized on several fronts.
Design.
On November 10 2005, Lee Felsenstein criticized the centralized, top-down, “imperialistic” design and distribution of the OLPC. Felsenstein, currently of the Fonley Institute, draws upon his previous experience with distributed collaboration and open source hardware in the Homebrew Computer Club.
Environmental concerns.
The project has received criticism due to concerns over environmental and health impacts of hazardous materials found in other computers. Many nations and organizations are working towards the development of “Green Electronics” (e.g. European Union with Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive).
While any project on this scale will have environmental impact, OLPC has asserted that it is aiming to use as many environmentally friendly materials as it can; that the laptop and all OLPC-supplied accessories will be fully compliant with the EU's Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS); and that the laptop will use an order of magnitude less power than the typical consumer notebooks available as of 2007, minimizing the environmental burden of power generation.
Effective use of money.
At the UN conference in Tunisia, several African officials, most notably Marthe Dansokho of Cameroon and Mohammed Diop of Mali, voiced suspicions towards the motives of the OLPC project and claimed that the project was using an overly American mindset that presented solutions not applicable to specifically African problems. Dansokho said the project demonstrated misplaced priorities, stating that clean water and schools were more important for African women, who, he stated, would not have time to use the computers to research new crops to grow. Diop specifically attacked the project as an attempt to exploit the governments of poor nations by making them pay for hundreds of millions of machines.
Additionally, the price of $188/unit does not include the cost of setup, maintenance, training of teachers, or Internet access. Countries adopting the XO-1 must budget for these costs as well.
One criticism has been that the money for purchasing laptops could be more favorably spent on libraries and schools. John Wood, founder of Room to Read, emphasizes affordability and scalability over high-tech solutions. While in favor of the One Laptop per Child initiative for providing education to children in the developing world at a cheaper rate, he has pointed out that a $2,000 library can serve 400 children, costing just $5 a child to bring access to a wide range of books in the local languages (such as Khmer or Nepali) and English; also, a $10,000 school can serve 400–500 children ($20–$25 a child). According to Wood, these are more appropriate solutions for education in the dense forests of Vietnam or rural Cambodia.
Give One Get One program order fulfillment problems.
The Give One Get One program, which was conducted by OLPC from 12 November 2007 through 31 December 2007, allowed North Americans to make a combined donation of USD$400 plus shipping to OLPC, for which they would receive an XO laptop of their own and have another sent on their behalf to a child in a developing country. Some 83,500 donors participated in the program. However, a significant minority (at least 10%) of these had not received their "Get One" laptop a couple months after their donation because of order fulfillment and shipment issues within both OLPC and the outside contractors it had hired to manage those aspects of the program. This led many donors to question whether OLPC's management and staff were capable of successfully managing the much larger task of distribution of laptops to the developing world.
Price.
India rejected the initiative, saying “it would be impossible to justify an expenditure of this scale on a debatable scheme when public funds continue to be in inadequate supply for well-established needs listed in different policy documents”. The Ministry of Human Resource Development of India has stated plans to make laptops at $10 for schoolchildren. Two designs submitted to the ministry from a final year engineering student of Vellore Institute of Technology and a researcher from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore reportedly describe a laptop that could be produced for "$47 per laptop" for even small volumes. No technical specifications or development timelines have been released.
Originally, the Argentinian government was promised the OLPC laptops for less than 100 USD with no strings attached. However, the final prototypes ended up costing almost twice as much and requires the government to commit to the OLPC program for 10 years. The funding from this project is expected to come from the Inter-American Development Bank (I.A.D.B.), leading to more controversy.
Nigerian (Lancor) lawsuit.
Lagos Analysis Corp., also called Lancor, a Lagos, Nigeria-based company, sued OLPC in the end of 2007 for $20 million, claiming that the computer's keyboard design was stolen from a Lancor patented device. The amount of damages is based upon an order by the Nigerian government for one million of the laptops. Lancor decided that, since their keyboards retail for $19.95, the $20 million is the price for one million keyboards. Lancor obtained a temporary injunction against the Nigerian sale in December of 2007, and the country's government announced that it is now reviewing its order.
OLPC responded by claiming that they had not sold any multi-lingual keyboards in the design claimed by Lancor, and that Lancor had misrepresented and concealed material facts before the court.
Pornography issue.
In 2007, XO laptops in Nigeria were reported to contain pornographic material belonging to children partaking in the OLPC Program. In response, OLPC made plans for adding content filters. The OLPC foundation maintained the position that such issues were societal, not laptop related. Similar responses have led some to suggest the OLPC takes an indifferent stance concerning this issue.. According to Wayan Vota of OLPC News, "The use of computers to look at porn is [a] social problem, not a hardware one, [...] Children have to be taught what's good and what's bad, based on the cultural context."
Media coverage similar to the Nigeria incidents have thus far been suspect of being smear attempts upon the OLPC Project, because of the personal level at which they go against the OLPC.
