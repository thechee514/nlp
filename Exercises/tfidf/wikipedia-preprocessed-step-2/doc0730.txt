Munich.
Munich (,;) is the capital of the German state of Bavaria and a Gamma World City. There are, in fact, three locations in Bavaria known as "München" - the one referred to as "Munich," one northeast of Nuremberg, and one north of Passau. Munich is located on the River Isar north of the Bavarian Alps.
Munich.
Munich is Germany's third largest city after Berlin and Hamburg. The city has a population of 1.35 million and the Munich Metropolitan Region is home to around 4.65 million people.
The city's motto was "'" ("The world city with heart") from 1972 to 2005, when it was replaced by "'" ("Munich likes you"). Its native name, ', stems from an Old German word predating the word "Mönche" of today's High German, meaning "Monks". Therefore, the figure on the city's coat-of-arms is a monk, and is referred to as the Münchner Kindl, the "child of Munich." Black and gold - the colors of the Holy Roman Empire - have been the city's official colors since the time of Ludwig the Bavarian.
Geography.
Munich lies on the elevated plains of Upper Bavaria, about 50 km north of the northern edge of the Alps, at an altitude of about 520 m. The local rivers are Isar and Würm.
Munich is situated in the Northern Alpine Foreland. The northern part of this sandy plateau includes a highly fertile flint area which is no longer affected by the folding processes found in the Alps, while the southern part is covered by morainic hills. In between there are fields of fluvio-glacial out-wash, like around Munich. Wherever these deposits get thinner, the ground water can permeate the gravel surface and flood the area, leading to marshes as in the north of Munich.
Climate.
Munich has a continental climate, strongly modified by the proximity of the Alps. The city's altitude and proximity to the northern edge of the Alps mean that precipitation is rather high. Rain storms often come violently and unexpectedly. The range of temperature between day and night or summer and winter can be extreme. A warm downwind from the Alps (a föhn wind) can change the temperatures completely within a few hours, even in the winter.
Winters last from December to March. Munich experiences rather cold winters, but heavy rainfall is rarely seen in the winter. The coldest month is January with an average temperature of. Snow cover is seen for at least a couple of weeks during winter. Summers in Munich city are fairly warm with average temperature of in the hottest month of July. The summers last from May until September.
Demographics.
In July 2007, Munich had 1.34 million inhabitants, 300,129 of whom did not hold German citizenship. The city has strong Turkish and Balkan communities. The largest groups of foreign nationals were Turks (43,309), Albanians (30,385), Croats (24,866), Serbs (24,439), Greek (22,486), Austrians (21,411), and Italians (20,847). 37% of foreign nationals come from the European Union.
With only 24,000 inhabitants in 1700, the population has doubled roughly every 30 years. For example, it had 100,000 people in 1852 and then 250,000 people in 1883; by 1901, the figure had doubled again to 500,000. Since then, Munich has become Germany's third largest city. In 1933, 840,901 inhabitants were counted and in 1957, Munich's population passed the 1 million mark.
39.5% of inhabitants are Roman Catholic and 14.2% Protestant (as of December 31 2005).
The population of the city is not very big in comparison with the 6 million inhabitants of the metropolitan area, because the suburbs are not ranked among the city, but among the metro-area. For example the airport belongs to the metropolitan area, however not to the city.
Origin and Middle Ages.
The year 1158 is assumed to be the foundation date, which is only the earliest date the city is mentioned in a document. By that time the Guelph Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony and Bavaria, had built a bridge over the river Isar next to a settlement of Benedictine monks - this was on the Salt Route and a toll bridge.
Almost two decades later in 1175 Munich was officially granted city status and received fortification. In 1180, with the trial of Henry the Lion, Otto I Wittelsbach became Duke of Bavaria and Munich was handed over to the Bishop of Freising. Otto's heirs, the Wittlesbach dynasty would rule Bavaria until 1918. In 1240 Munich itself was transferred to Otto II Wittelsbach and in 1255, when the Duchy of Bavaria was split in two, Munich became the ducal residence of Upper Bavaria.
Duke Louis IV was elected German king in 1314 and crowned as Holy Roman Emperor in 1328. He strengthened the city's position by granting it the salt monopoly, thus assuring it of additional income. In the late 15th century Munich underwent a revival of gothic arts - the Old Town Hall was enlarged, and a new cathedral - the Frauenkirche - constructed within only twenty years, starting in 1468.
Capital of reunited Bavaria.
When Bavaria was reunited in 1506 Munich became capital of the whole of Bavaria. The arts and politics became increasingly influenced by the court (see Orlando di Lasso, Heinrich Schuetz and later Mozart and Richard Wagner). During the 16th century Munich was a center of the German counter reformation, and also of renaissance arts. Duke Wilhelm V commissioned the Jesuit Michaelskirche, which became a center for the counter-reformation, and also built the Hofbräuhaus for brewing brown beer in 1589.
The Catholic League was founded in Munich in 1609.
In 1623 during the Thirty Years' War Munich became electoral residence when Maximilian I, Duke of Bavaria was invested with the electoral dignity but in 1632 the city was occupied by Gustav II Adolph of Sweden. When the bubonic plague broke out in 1634 and 1635 about one third of the population died. Under the regency of the Bavarian electors Munich was an important center of baroque life but also had to suffer under Habsburg occupations in 1704 and 1742.
In 1806, the city became the capital of the new Kingdom of Bavaria, with the state's parliament (the "Landtag)" and the new archdiocese of Munich and Freising being located in the city. Twenty years later Landshut University was moved to Munich. Many of the city's finest buildings belong to this period and were built under the first three Bavarian kings. Later Prince Regent Luitpold's years as regent were marked by tremendous artistic and cultural activity in Munich (see Franz von Stuck and Der Blaue Reiter).
World War I to World War II.
Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, life in Munich became very difficult, as the Allied blockade of Germany led to food and fuel shortages. During French air raids in 1916 three bombs fell on Munich.
After World War I, the city was at the center of much political unrest. In November 1918 on the eve of revolution, Ludwig III and his family fled the city. After the murder of the first republican premier of Bavaria Kurt Eisner in February 1919 by Anton Graf von Arco-Valley, the Bavarian Soviet Republic was proclaimed. When Communists had taken power, Lenin, who had lived in Munich some years before, sent a congratulatory telegram, but the Soviet Republic was put down on May 3, 1919 by the Freikorps. While the republican government had been restored, Munich subsequently became a hotbed of right-wing politics, among which Adolf Hitler and the Nazis rose to prominence.
In 1923 Hitler and his supporters, who at that time were concentrated in Munich, staged the Beer Hall Putsch, an attempt to overthrow the Weimar Republic and seize power. The revolt failed, resulting in Hitler's arrest and the temporary crippling of the Nazi Party, which was virtually unknown outside Munich.
The city would once again become a Nazi stronghold when the Nazis took power in Germany in 1933. The Nazis created the first concentration camp at Dachau, 10 miles (16 km) north west of the city. Because of its importance to the rise of Nazism, the Nazis called Munich the "Hauptstadt der Bewegung" ("Capital of the Movement"). The NSDAP headquarters were in Munich and many "Führerbauten" ("Führer"-buildings") were built around the Königsplatz, some of which have survived to this day.
The city is known as the site of the culmination of the policy of appeasement employed by Britain and France leading up to World War II. It was in Munich that Neville Chamberlain assented to the annexation of Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland region into Greater Germany in the hopes of sating the desires of the Nazi Party.
Munich was the base of the White Rose (German: "Die Weiße Rose"), a group of students that formed a resistance movement from June 1942 to February 1943. The core members were arrested and executed following a distribution of leaflets in Munich University by Hans and Sophie Scholl.
The city was very heavily damaged by allied bombing during World War II - the city was hit by 71 air raids over a period of six years.
Postwar Munich.
After American occupation in 1945, Munich was completely rebuilt following a meticulous and - by comparison to other war-ravaged German cities - rather conservative plan which preserved its pre-war street grid. In 1957 Munich's population passed the 1 million mark.
Munich was the site of the 1972 Summer Olympics, during which Israeli athletes were assassinated by Palestinian terrorists (see Munich massacre), when terrorist gunmen from the Palestinian "Black September" group took hostage members of the Israeli Olympic team.
Residents of Munich typically enjoy a high quality of life. Mercer HR Consulting consistently rates the city among the top 10 cities with highest quality of life worldwide - a 2007 survey ranked Munich as 8th. The same company also ranks Munich as the world's 39th most expensive city to live in and the most expensive major city in Germany. Munich enjoys a thriving economy, driven by the information technology, biotechnology, and publishing sectors. Environmental pollution is comparatively low, although as of 2006 the city council is concerned about levels of particulate matter (PM), especially along the city's major thoroughfares. Since the enactment of EU legislation concerning the concentration of particulate in the air, environmental groups such as Greenpeace have staged large protest rallies to urge the city council and the State government to take a harder stance on pollution.
Public transport is very efficient with an extensive underground (U-Bahn) and suburban (S-Bahn) railway system. The crime rate is very low compared to other large German cities, such as Hamburg or Berlin. This high quality of life and safety has caused the city to be nicknamed "Millionendorf", a mildly derogatory expression which means "village of a million people".
Politics.
Munich's current mayor is Christian Ude of the SPD (Social Democratic Party of Germany). Munich has a nearly unbroken history of SPD governments since World War II, which is remarkable because the rest of Bavaria is a conservative stronghold, with the CSU (Christian Social Union) winning absolute majorities among the Bavarian electorate in many elections at the communal, state, and federal levels.
As capital of Bavaria, Munich is an important political centre in Germany and the seat of the Bavarian Landtag (the state parliament), the Staatskanzlei (the state chancellery) and of all state departments.
Several national and international authorities are located in Munich, including the Bundesfinanzhof (the highest German tax court) and the European Patent Office.
Subdivisions.
Munich is subdivided into 25 boroughs.
The inner city.
At the centre of the city is the "Marienplatz" - a large open square named after the Mariensäule (erected in gratefulness for deliveration from the plague), a Marian column in its centre - with the Old and the New Town Hall. Its tower contains the "Rathaus-Glockenspiel". Three gates of the demolished medieval fortification have survived to this day - the "Isartor" in the east, the "Sendlinger Tor" in the south and the "Karlstor" in the west of the inner city. The Karlstor (destroyed during the Second World War and rebuilt afterwards) leads up to the "Stachus", a grand square dominated by the "Justizpalast (Palace of Justice)" and a fountain.
The "Peterskirche" close to Marienplatz is the oldest church of the inner city. It was first built during the Romanesque period, and was the focus of the early monastic settlement in Munich before the city's official foundation in 1158. Nearby St. Peter the Gothic hall-church "Heiliggeistkirche" (The Church of the Holy Ghost) was converted to baroque style from 1724 onwards and looks down upon the Viktualienmarkt, the most popular market of Munich.
The "Frauenkirche" (Dom zu unserer Lieben Frau - Cathedral of Our Lady) is the most famous building in the city centre and serves as cathedral for the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising.
The nearby "Michaelskirche" is the largest renaissance church north of the Alps, while the "Theatinerkirche" is a basilica in Italianate high baroque which had a major influence on Southern German baroque architecture. Its dome dominates the Odeonsplatz. Other baroque churches in the inner city which are worth a detour are the "Bürgersaalkirche", the "Dreifaltigkeitskirche", the "St. Anna Damenstiftskirche" and "St. Anna im Lehel", the first rococo church in Bavaria. The "Asamkirche" was endowed and built by the Brothers Asam, pioneering artists of the rococo period.
The large "Residenz" palace complex (begun in 1385) on the edge of Munich's Old Town ranks among Europe's most significant museums of interior decoration. Having undergone several extensions, it contains also the treasury and the splendid rococo "Cuvilliés Theatre". Next door to the Residenz the neo-classical opera, the "Nationaltheater" was erected.
The royal avenues and squares.
The neoclassical "Brienner Straße", starting at "Odeonsplatz" on the northern fringe of the Old Town close to the Residenz, runs from east to west and opens into the impressive "Königsplatz", designed with the "Doric" "Propyläen", the "Ionic" "Glyptothek" and the "Corinthian" "State Museum of Classical Art", on its back side St. Boniface's Abbey was erected. The area around Königsplatz is home to the Kunstareal, Munich's gallery and museum quarter (as described below).
"Ludwigstraße" also begins at "Odeonsplatz" and runs from south to north, skirting the "Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität", the "St. Louis church", the "Bavarian State Library" and numerous state ministries and palaces. The southern part of the avenue was constructed in Italian renaissance style while the north is strongly influenced by Italian Romanesque architecture.
The neo-Gothic "Maximilianstraße" starts at "Max-Joseph-Platz", where the "Residenz" and the National Theatre are situated, and runs from west to east. The avenue is framed by neo-Gothic buildings which house, among others, the "Schauspielhaus" and the building of the district government of Upper Bavaria and the Museum of Ethnology. After crossing the river Isar, the avenue circles the "Maximilianeum", home of the state parliament. The western portion of Maximilianstrasse is known for its designer shops, luxury boutiques, jewellery stores, and one of Munich's foremost five-star hotels, the "Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten".
"Prinzregentenstraße" runs parallel to Maximilianstraße and begins at "Prinz-Carl-Palais". Many museums can be found along the avenue, such as the "Haus der Kunst", the "Bavarian National Museum" and the "Schackgalerie". The avenue crosses the Isar and circles the "Friedensengel monument" passing the "Villa Stuck" and Hitler's old apartment. The "Prinzregententheater" is at Prinzregentenplatz further to the east.
Other boroughs.
Two large baroque palaces in Nymphenburg and Oberschleißheim are reminders of Bavaria's royal past. "Schloss Nymphenburg" ("Nymphenburg Palace"), some 6 km north west of the city centre, is surrounded by an impressive park and is considered to be one of Europe's most beautiful royal residences. 2 km north west of Nymphenburg Palace is "Schloss Blutenburg" ("Blutenburg Castle"), an old ducal country seat with a late-Gothic palace church. "Schloss Fürstenried" ("Fürstenried Palace"), a baroque palace of similar structure to Nymphenburg but of much smaller size, was contemporaneously erected in the south west of Munich. The second large baroque residence is "Schloss Schleißheim" ("Schleissheim Palace"), located in the suburb of Oberschleissheim, a palace complex encompassing three separate residences: "Altes Schloss Schleißheim" (the old palace), "Neues Schloss Schleißheim" (the new palace) and "Schloss Lustheim" (Lustheim Palace). Most parts of the palace complex serve as museums and art galleries. Deutsches Museum's "Flugwerft Schleißheim" flight exhibition centre is located nearby, on the Schleißheim Special Landing Field.
"St Michael in Berg am Laim" might be the most remarkable church out of the inner city. Most of the boroughs have parish churches which originate from the Middle Ages like the most famous church of pilgrimage in Munich "St Mary in Ramersdorf". The oldest church within the city borders is "Heilig Kreuz" in Fröttmaning next to the Allianz-Arena, known for its Romanesque fresco.
Especially in its suburbs Munich features a wide and diverse array of modern architecture, although strict height limitations for buildings have limited the construction of skyscrapers. Most high-rise buildings are clustered at the northern edge of Munich in the skyline, like the Hypo-Haus, the Arabella High-Rise Building, the Highlight Towers, Uptown Munich, Münchner Tor and the BMW Headquarters next to the Olympic Park. Several other high-rise buildings are located near the city center and on the Siemens campus in southern Munich. A landmark of modern Munich is also the architecture of the sport stadiums (as described below).
In Giesing is the former McGraw Kaserne, a former U.S. army base, near Stadelheim Prison.
The parks.
Munich is a green city with numerous parks. The "Englischer Garten", close to the city centre and covering an area of 3.7 km², is one of the world's largest urban public parks, and contains a nudist area, jogging tracks and bridle-paths. It was devised and laid out by Benjamin Thompson, Count of Rumford, an American, for both pleasure and as work area for the city's vargants and homeless. Noweadays it is entirley a park with a Biergarten at the Chinese Pagoda.
Other large green spaces are the modern "Olympiapark" and "Westpark" as well as the parks of Nymphenburg Palace (with the "Botanical Garden" to the north), and Schleissheim Palace. The city's oldest park is the "Hofgarten", near the Residenz, and dating back to the 16th century. Most known for the largest beergarden in the town is the former royal "Hirschgarten", founded in 1780 for deer which still live there.
The city's zoo is the "Tierpark Hellabrunn" near the Flaucher Island in the Isar in the south of the city. Another notable park is Ostpark, located in Perlach-Ramersdorf area which houses the swimming area, "Michaelibad", one of the largest in Munich.
Sports.
Munich is home to several professional football (soccer) teams, including Germany's most popular club, FC Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich. The Munich area currently has two teams in the Bundesliga system, which comprises the two top divisions of German football. The city's hockey club is EHC Munich.
Munich has also hosted the Munich Summer Olympics in 1972 and was one of the host cities for the 2006 World Cup which was not held in Munich's Olympic Stadium but in a new soccer specific stadium, the Allianz Arena.
Museums.
The "Deutsches Museum", located on an island in the Isar, is one of the oldest and largest science museums in the world. Three redundant exhibition buildings which are under a protection order were converted to house the "Verkehrsmuseum", which houses the land transport collections of the Deutsches Museum. Deutsches Museum's "Flugwerft Schleißheim" flight exhibition centre is located nearby, on the Schleißheim Special Landing Field.
Several non-centralised museums (many of those are public collections at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität) show the expanded state collections of palaeontology, geology, mineralogy, zoology, botany and anthropology.
The city has several important art galleries, most of which can be found in the "Kunstareal", including the "Alte Pinakothek," the "Neue Pinakothek," and the "Pinakothek der Moderne". Alte Pinakothek's rather monolithic structure contains a treasure trove of the works of European masters between the 14th and 18th centuries. The collection reflects the eclectic tastes of the Wittelsbachs over four centuries, and is sorted by schools over two sprawling floors. Major displays include Albrecht Dürer's Christ-like Self-Portrait, his Four Apostles, Raphael's paintings" The Canigiani Holy Family" and" Madonna Tempi" as well as Peter Paul Rubens two-storey-high "Judgment Day". The gallery houses one of the world's most comprehensive Rubens collections. Before World War I, the Blaue Reiter group of artists worked in Munich. Many of their works can now be seen at the "Lenbachhaus".
An important collection of Greek and Roman art is held in the "Glyptothek" and the "Staatliche Antikensammlung" (State Antiquities Collection). King Ludwig I managed to acquire such famous pieces as the Medusa Rondanini, the Barberini Faun and the figures from the Temple of Aphaea on Aegina for the Glyptothek. The Kunstareal will be further augmented by the completion of the "Egyptian Museum".
The famous gothic Morris dancers of Erasmus Grasser are exhibited in the "Munich City Museum" in the old gothic arsenal building in the inner city.
Another area for the arts next to the Kunstareal is the Lehel quarter between the old town and the river Isar: The "State Museum of Ethnology" in Maximilianstrasse is the second largest collection in Germany of artifacts and objects from outside Europe, while the "Bavarian National Museum" and the adjoining "State Archeological Collections" in Prinzregentenstrasse rank among Europe's major art and cultural history museums. The nearby "Schackgalerie" is an important gallery of German 19th century paintings.
The Dachau concentration camp is just a few kilometers outside the city.
Arts and literature.
Munich is a major European cultural centre and the domain of many prominent composers including Orlando di Lasso, W.A. Mozart, Carl Maria von Weber, Richard Wagner, Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, Max Reger and Carl Orff. With the Biennale, founded by Hans Werner Henze the city still contributes to modern music theatre.
The "Nationaltheater" where several of Richard Wagner's operas had their premieres under the patronage of Ludwig II of Bavaria is the home of the Bavarian State Opera and the Bavarian State Orchestra. Next door the modern "Residenz Theatre" was erected in the building that had housed the "Cuvilliés Theatre" before World War II. Many operas were staged there, including the premiere of Mozart's "Idomeneo" in 1781. The "Gärtnerplatz Theatre" is a ballet and musical state theatre while another opera house the "Prinzregententheater" has become the home of the Bavarian Theatre Academy.
The modern "Gasteig" center houses the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra. The third orchestra in Munich with international importance is the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. Its primary concert venue is the "Herkulesaal" in the Residenz. A stage for shows, big events and musicals is the "Deutsche Theater".
Next to the Bavarian Staatsschauspiel in the Residenz Theatre (Residenztheater), the "Munich Kammerspiele" in the Schauspielhaus is one of the most important German language theatres in the world. Since Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's premieres in 1775 many important writers have staged their plays in Munich such as Christian Friedrich Hebbel, Henrik Ibsen and Hugo von Hofmannsthal.
Prominent literary figures worked in Munich especially during the final centuries of the Kingdom of Bavaria such as Paul Heyse, Rainer Maria Rilke and Frank Wedekind.
The period immediately before World War I saw particular economic and cultural prominence for the city. Munich, and especially its suburb of Schwabing, became the domicile of many artists and writers. Thomas Mann who also lived there wrote in his novella Gladius Dei about this period "Munich shone". Munich remained a center of cultural life also during the Weimar period, as figures such as Lion Feuchtwanger, Bertolt Brecht and Oskar Maria Graf were active. In 1919 the Bavaria Film Studios were founded.
Munich had already become an important place for painters like Carl Rottmann, Lovis Corinth, Wilhelm von Kaulbach, Carl Spitzweg, Franz von Lenbach, Franz von Stuck and Wilhelm Leibl when Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), a group of expressionist artists, was established in Munich in 1911. The city was a home the Blue Rider's painters Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, Alexej von Jawlensky, Gabriele Münter, Franz Marc, August Macke and Alfred Kubin.
Hofbräuhaus and Oktoberfest.
The Hofbräuhaus am Platzl, arguably the most famous beer hall worldwide, is located in the city centre. It also operates the second largest tent at the Oktoberfest, one of Munich's most famous attractions. For two weeks, the Oktoberfest, attracts millions of people visiting its beer tents ("Bierzelte") and fairground attractions. The Oktoberfest was first held on October 12, 1810 in honor of the marriage of crown prince Ludwig to Princess Therese von Sachsen-Hildburghausen. The festivities were closed with a horse race and in the following years the horse races were continued and later developed into what is now known as the Oktoberfest. Despite its name, most of Oktoberfest occurs in September. It always finishes on the first Sunday in October unless the German national holiday on 3 October ("Tag der deutschen Einheit" - Day of German Unity) is a Monday or Tuesday - then the Oktoberfest remains open for these days.
Culinary specialities.
The "Weißwürste" ('white sausages'), traditionally eaten only before 12 p.m. (when there were no refrigerators they used to be best until that time), often served with sweet mustard and freshly baked "Brezen" (pretzels) are a Munich speciality, as is Leberkäs, Bavarian baked sausage loaf often served with potato salad.
The most famous soup might be the "Leberknödel" Soup. "Leberknödel" is a bread dumpling seasoned with liver and onions.
"Schweinebraten" (pot roasted pork) with "Knödel" (dumplings made from potatoes and/or white bread) and "Kraut" (cabbage) or a "Schweinshaxe" (pork knuckle) are served as lunch or dinner. "Beuscherl", a plate of lung, heart and spleen is also served with dumplings.
Popular as dessert is the "Apfelstrudel" apple strudel with vanilla sauce, the "Millirahmstrudel" a cream cheese strudel, "Dampfnudeln" (yeast dumplings served with custard) or "Auszogene", a fried pastry shaped like a large donut but without a hole. Not forgetting the famous Prinzregententorte created in honour of the prince regent Luitpold.
Some specialities are typical cold dishes served in beergardens: "Obatzda" is a Bavarian cheese delicacy, a savoury blend of smashed mellow camembert prepared with cream cheese, cut onions and spicy paprika (and sometimes some butter). It's often served in the beergardens as well as "Radi" (radish), white radish cut in thin slices and salted, and "Münchner Wurstsalat", Munich's famous sausage salad with thinly sliced Knackwurst marinated in vinegar and oil with onions on a bed of lettuce.
Popular grilled meals include "Steckerlfisch" is a local fish, such as trout or whitefish, speared on a wooden stick, grilled and smoked on charcoal - the typical feature is the crispy skin. Another classic is "A hoibs Hendl" (half a grilled chicken). A "Maß" (die Maß) is a litre of beer, a "Radler" consists of half beer and half lemonade.
Local beers brewed in Munich.
Munich is famous for its breweries and the "Weißbier" (or "Weizenbier", wheat beer) is a speciality from Bavaria. "Helles" with its translucent gold colour is the most popular Munich beer today, although it’s not very old (only introduced in 1895). Helles and Pils have almost ousted the "Munich Dark Beer" ("Dunkles"), which gets its dark colour from burnt malt, the most popular beer in Munich within the 19th century.
"Starkbier" is the strongest Munich beer, containing 6–9 percent alcohol. It is dark amber and has a heavy malty taste. It is available and popular during the Lenten "Starkbierzeit" (strong beer season), which begins on or before St. Joseph’s Day (March 19th). There are around 20 major beer gardens, with four of the most famous and popular being located in the Englischer Garten and the largest one in the Hirschgarten.
Markets.
The "Viktualienmarkt" is Munich's most popular market for fresh food and delicatessen. A very old feature of Munich's Fasching (carnival) is the dance of the Marktfrauen (market women) of the Viktualienmarkt in comical costumes.
The "Auer Dult" is held three times a year on the square around Mariahilf church and is one of Munich's oldest markets, well known for its jumble sale and antiques.
Three weeks before Christmas the "Christkindlmarkt" opens at Marienplatz and other squares in the city, selling Christmas goods.
Nightlife in Munich.
Nightlife in Munich is thriving with over 6,000 licensed establishments in the city, especially in Schwabing, which is still the main quarter for students and artists. Some notable establishments are: the touristy "Hofbräuhaus", one of the oldest breweries in Munich, located in the city center near Tal; Kultfabrik and Optimolwerke, former industrial areas converted to host many different discos and pubs; Munich's gay quarter is in Isarvorstadt, surrounding the Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz, also known as the Glockenbachviertel.
Colleges and universities.
Munich is a leading location for science and research with a long list of Nobel Prize laureates from Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen in 1901 to Theodor Hänsch in 2005. Munich has become a spiritual centre already since the times of Emperor Louis IV when philosophers like Michael of Cesena, Marsilius of Padua and William of Ockham were protected at the emperor's court. Both the universities of the Bavarian metropolis, the Ludwig Maximilian University (LMU) and the Technical University (TU or TUM), were found to be worthy of the title of elite university by the selection committee, which consisted of academics and members of the Ministries of Education and Research of the Federation and the German states (Länder). Only Munich's two universities and the Technical University of Karlsruhe have been awarded already in 2006 the title of elite university of Germany and millions of euro in funding.
Economy.
Munich has the strongest economy of any German city, as well as the lowest unemployment rate (5.6 %) of any German city with more than a million people (the other ones being Berlin and Hamburg). The city is also the economic centre of southern Germany. The initiative “Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft (INSM)” (New Social Market Economy) and the “WirtschaftsWoche” (Business Weekly) magazine have awarded Munich the top score in their comparative survey for the third time in June 2006. Munich topped the ranking of the magazine “Capital” in February 2005 for the economic prospects between 2002 and 2011 in sixty German cities. Munich is considered a global city and holds the headquarters of Siemens AG (electronics), BMW (car), MAN AG (truck manufacturer, engineering), Linde (gases), Allianz (insurance) and Munich Re (re-insurance). Among German cities with more than 500,000 inhabitants purchasing power is highest in Munich (26.648 Euros per inhabitant) as of 2007.
Munich is also a centre for biotechnology, software and other service industries. Munich is also the home of the headquarters of many other large companies like the aircraft engine manufacturer MTU Aero Engines, the space and defence contractor EADS (headquartered in the suburban town of Ottobrunn), the injection molding machine manufacturer Krauss-Maffei, the camera and lighting manufacturer Arri, the semiconductor firm Infineon Technologies (headquartered in the suburban town of Neubiberg), the DRAM company Qimonda, as well as the German or European headquarters of many foreign companies like Precision Plus, McDonald’s and Microsoft.
Munich has significance as a financial centre (secondary to Frankfurt), being home of HypoVereinsbank and the Bayerische Landesbank. It outranks Frankfurt though as home of insurance companies like Allianz and Munich Re.
Munich is the largest publishing city in Europe and home to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, one of Germany's largest daily newspapers. Munich is also home to Germany's largest public broadcasting network, ARD, and its largest commercial network, Pro7-Sat1 Media AG, and is also host to the Burda publishing group.
The Bavaria Film Studios are located in the suburb of Grünwald. They are one of Europe's biggest and most famous movie production studios.
Lufthansa has opened a second hub at Munich's Franz Josef Strauss International Airport, the second-largest airport in Germany, after Frankfurt International Airport.
Munich International Airport.
Franz Josef Strauss International Airport (IATA: MUC, ICAO: EDDM) is with about 34 Mio. pax/year Germany's second largest airport after Frankfurt, some 30 km to the north east of the city centre. The airport can be reached by suburban train lines S1 from the east and S8 from the west part of the city. However, from the Hauptbahnhof (main railway station), the journey takes 40–45 minutes. A magnetic levitation train (called Transrapid) which will run at speeds of up to 400 km/h from the central station to the airport has been approved. It will reduce the travel time from the Hauptbahnhof to only 10 minutes. As of January 2008 the Transrapid project has been put on hold pending the outcome of a local referendum. The Transrapid project has also lost some of the much needed funding. Given the Anti-Transrapid sentiment of the taxpayers and the lack of sufficient funding for the project, many believe the project will not see the light of day.
The airport began operations in 1992, replacing the former main airport, the Munich-Riem airport (active 1939–1992).
Also, the Bavarian state government has announced plans to expand the Oberpfaffenhofen Air Station, located west of Munich, for commercial use. These plans are opposed by many residents of the Oberpfaffenhofen area.
Public transportation.
For its population, Munich has one of the most comprehensive systems in the world, incorporating the Munich U-Bahn (underground railway), the Munich S-Bahn (suburban trains), trams and buses. The system is supervised by the Munich Transport and Tariff Association (Münchner Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund GmbH).
The main railway station is Munich Hauptbahnhof (Central Station), in the city centre, and there are two smaller main line stations at Pasing (Pasing Station), in the west of the city, and Munich Ostbahnhof (East Station) in the east. All three are connected to the public transport system and serve as transportation hubs.
ICE highspeed trains stop at Munich-Pasing and Munich-Hauptbahnhof only. InterCity and EuroCity trains with destinations East of Munich also stop at Munich East. Since 28 May 2006 Munich is connected to Nuremberg via Ingolstadt by a 300 km/h ICE high speed railway line.
Individual transportation.
Munich is an integral part of the Autobahn network of southern Germany. Freeways from Stuttgart, Berlin, Frankfurt, Lindau, Garmisch Partenkirchen and Salzburg terminate at Munich, making it easy to access the different parts of Germany, Austria and Italy. However, traffic in and around Munich is often heavy (especially on the beltway, a 3-5 lane freeway and on the inner-city freeways). Traffic jams are commonplace during rush hour and at the beginning and end of major vacations in Germany.
Cycling is recognised as a good alternative to motorised transport and the growing number of bicycle lanes are widely used throughout the year. A modern bike hire system is available in the central area of Munich that is surrounded by the beltway.
Around Munich.
The Munich agglomeration sprawls across the plain of the Alpine foothills. Several smaller traditional Bavarian towns like Freising, Erding and Moosburg are today part of the Munich region formed by Munich and the surrounding districts.
