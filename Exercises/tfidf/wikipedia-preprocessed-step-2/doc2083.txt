William F. Buckley, Jr..
William Frank Buckley, Jr. (November 24 1925 – February 27 2008) was an American author and conservative commentator. He founded the political magazine "National Review" in 1955, hosted 1429 episodes of the television show "Firing Line" from 1966 until 1999, and was a nationally syndicated newspaper columnist. His writing style was famed for its erudition, wit, and use of uncommon words.
Buckley was "arguably the most important public intellectual in the United States in the past half century," according to George H. Nash, a historian of the modern American conservative movement. "For an entire generation he was the preeminent voice of American conservatism and its first great ecumenical figure." Buckley's primary intellectual achievement was to fuse traditional American political conservatism with economic libertarianism and anti-communism, laying the groundwork for the modern American conservatism of US Presidential candidate Barry Goldwater and US President Ronald Reagan.
Buckley came on the public scene with his critical essay "God and Man at Yale" (1951); among over fifty further books on writing, speaking, history, politics and sailing, were a series of novels featuring the character of CIA agent Blackford Oakes. Buckley referred to himself "on and off" as either libertarian or conservative. He resided in New York City and Stamford, Connecticut, and often signed his name as "WFB." He was a practicing Catholic, often attending the traditional Latin Mass in Connecticut.
Early life.
Buckley was born in New York City to lawyer and oil baron William Frank Buckley, Sr., of Irish-Catholic descent, and Aloise Steiner, a Southerner of Swiss-German descent. The sixth of ten children, as a boy Buckley moved with his family to Sharon, Connecticut before beginning his first formal schooling in Paris, where he attended first grade. By age seven, he received his first formal training in English at a day school in London, (his first and second languages were Spanish and French, respectively). As a boy, Buckley developed a love for music, sailing, horses, hunting, skiing, and story-telling. All of these interests would reflect in his later writings. Just before World War II, at age 13, he attended high school at the Catholic Beaumont College in England. During the war, his family took in the future British historian, Alistair Horne, as a war evacuee. Buckley and Horne remained life-long friends. Buckley and Horne both attended Millbrook School, in Millbrook, New York, and graduated as members of the Class of 1943. At Millbrook, Buckley founded and edited the school's yearbook, "The Tamarack", his first experience in publishing. When Buckley was a young man, his father was an acquaintance of libertarian author Albert Jay Nock. William F. Buckley, Sr., encouraged his son to read Nock's works.
In his younger years, Buckley developed many talents; he played the harpsichord very well and did so once on "Late Night With Conan O'Brien". He was an accomplished pianist, appearing once on Marian McPartland's National Public Radio show "Piano Jazz". A great fan of Johann Sebastian Bach, he has said that he would want Bach's music played at his funeral.
Marriage and family.
In 1950, Buckley married Patricia Alden Austin "Pat" Taylor (July 1 1926 – April 15 2007), the daughter of industrialist Austin C. Taylor. He met Pat, a Protestant from Vancouver, British Columbia, while she was a student at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York. Pat Buckley was a prominent charity fundraiser for such organizations as the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery at New York University Medical Center and the Hospital for Special Surgery. She also raised money for Vietnam War veterans and AIDS patients. On April 15 2007, she died of an infection after a long illness at age 80.
The couple had one son, author Christopher Buckley. He took great pride in the success of his son, and in his final years would frequently call friends late at night to read them passages from "Christo's" latest book. After Buckley's wife, Pat, died in April 2007, said his friend, Christopher Little, he "seemed dejected and rudderless".
Buckley had nine siblings, including sister Maureen Buckley-O'Reilly, who married Gerald O'Reilly and had several children before suddenly dying of a brain aneurism in 1966; sister Priscilla L. Buckley, author of ' for which William wrote the foreword; brother Fergus Reid Buckley, an author, debate-master, and founder of the Buckley School of Public Speaking; and brother James L. Buckley, is a former senior judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and a former US Senator from New York. William and James appeared together on "Firing Line". Buckley co-authored a book, "McCarthy and His Enemies", with his brother-in-law, attorney L. Brent Bozell Jr. Bozell's son, L. Brent Bozell, III, is an author, political commentator, and founder of the "Media Research Center".
Education, military service and the CIA.
Buckley attended the National Autonomous University of Mexico (or UNAM) in 1943 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the US Army the following year, upon his graduation from the US Army Officer Candidate School. In his book, "Miles Gone By", he briefly recounts being a member of Franklin Roosevelt's honor guard when the president died. With the end of World War II in 1945, he enrolled in Yale University, where he became a member of the secret Skull and Bones society, was a debater, an active member of the Conservative Party and of the Yale Political Union, and served as Editor-in-Chief of the Yale Daily News.
Buckley studied political science, history and economics at Yale, graduating with honors in 1950. Buckley excelled as the captain of the Yale Debate Team. Under the tutelage of Yale professor Rollin G. Osterweis, Buckley honed his acerbic style. Osterweis recalled that Buckley showed up at the annual Harvard-Yale debate in a jacket and tie and shorts. When quizzed about his outfit, Buckley responded that he "thought it would be a sporting contest".
In 1951 he was recruited into the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), yet served for less than a year. Little has been published regarding Buckley's work with the CIA, but in a 2001 letter to author W. Thomas Smith, Jr., Buckley wrote, “I did training in Washington as a secret agent and was sent to Mexico City. There I served under the direct supervision of Howard Hunt, about whom of course a great deal is known.”
When in 1951 I was inducted into the CIA as a deep cover agent, the procedures for disguising my affiliation and my work were unsmilingly comprehensive. It was three months before I was formally permitted to inform my wife what the real reason was for going to Mexico City to live. If, a year later, I had been apprehended, dosed with sodium pentothal, and forced to give out the names of everyone I knew in the CIA, I could have come up with exactly one name, that of my immediate boss (E. Howard Hunt, as it happened). In the passage of time one can indulge in idle talk on spook life. In 1980 I found myself seated next to the former president of Mexico at a ski-area restaurant. What, he asked amiably, had I done when I lived in Mexico? "I tried to undermine your regime, Mr. President." He thought this amusing, and that is all that it was, under the aspect of the heavens.
While in Mexico, Buckley edited "The Road to Yenan", a book addressing the communist quest for global domination, by Peruvian author Eudocio Ravines.
First books.
In 1951, the same year he was recruited into the CIA, Buckley's first book, "God and Man at Yale", was published. The book was written in Hamden, Connecticut, where William and Pat Buckley had settled as newlyweds. A critique of Yale University, the work argues that the school had strayed from its original educational mission. The next year, he made some telling concessions in an article for "Commonweal."
We have got to accept Big Government for the duration—for neither an offensive nor a defensive war can be waged, given our present government skills, except through the instrument of a totalitarian bureaucracy within our shores. … And if they deem Soviet power a menace to our freedom (as I happen to), they will have to support large armies and air forces, atomic energy, central intelligence, war production boards, and the attendant centralization of power in Washington—even with Truman at the reins of it all.
In 1954, Buckley co-wrote a book with his brother-in-law, L. Brent Bozell Jr., entitled "McCarthy and His Enemies", in which Buckley and Bozell strongly defended Wisconsin U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy, albeit with some reservations, as a patriotic crusader against communism.
"National Review", Young Americans for Freedom, Barry Goldwater.
Buckley worked as an editor for "The American Mercury" in 1951 and 1952, but left after spotting anti-Semitic tendencies in the magazine. He then founded "National Review" in 1955, serving as editor-in-chief until 1990. During that time, "National Review" became the standard-bearer of American conservatism, promoting the fusion of traditional conservatives and libertarians.
In 1957, Buckley published of Ayn Rand's "Atlas Shrugged" by Whittaker Chambers, ostensibly "reading her out of the conservative movement." Objectivists have accused Chambers of merely skimming the novel. Buckley said that Rand never forgave him for publishing the review and that "for the rest of her life, she would walk theatrically out of any room I entered!"
Also in 1957, Buckley came out in support of the segregationist South, famously writing that "the central question that emerges…is whether the White community in the South is entitled to take such measures as are necessary to prevail, politically and culturally, in areas where it does not predominate numerically? The sobering answer is Yes — the White community is so entitled because, for the time being, it is the advanced race." Buckley changed his views and by the mid-1960s renounced racism. This change was caused in part because of his reaction to the tactics used by white supremacists against the civil rights movement, and in part because of the influence of friends like Garry Wills who confronted Buckley on the morality of his politics. By the late 1960s, Buckley disagreed strenuously with segregationist George Wallace, and Buckley later said it was a mistake for "National Review" to have opposed the civil rights legislation of 1964-65. He later grew to admire Martin Luther King, Jr. and supported creation of a national holiday for him.
As late as 2004, he defended his statement, at least the part referring to African Americans not being "advanced": He pointed out the word "Advancement" in the name N.A.A.C.P. and continued, "The call for the 'advancement' of colored people presupposes they are behind. Which they were, in 1958, by any standards of measurement."
In 1960, Buckley helped form "Young Americans for Freedom" and in 1964 he very strongly supported the candidacy of Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, first for the Republican nomination against New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and then for the Presidency. Buckley used "National Review" as a forum for mobilizing support for Goldwater.
In 1962, Buckley denounced Robert W. Welch, Jr., and the John Birch Society, in the "National Review", as "far removed from common sense" and urged the GOP to purge itself of Mr. Welch's influence.
"On The Right".
Buckley's column "On The Right" was syndicated by Universal Press Syndicate beginning in 1962. From the early 1970s, his twice-weekly column was distributed to more than 320 newspapers across the country. In the early 1960's, at Sharon, Connecticut, Buckley founded the conservative political youth group, "Young Americans for Freedom." (Y.A.F.) Young Americans for Freedom was guided by principles Buckley called, "The Sharon Statement." Brother Jim Buckley's capture of the U. S. Senate seat from New York State in the early 1970's was due in a large part to the activist support of the New York State chapter of Y.A.F.
Mayoral candidacy.
In 1965, he ran for mayor of New York City as the candidate for the young Conservative Party, because of his dissatisfaction with the very liberal Republican candidate and fellow Yale alumnus John V. Lindsay, who later became a Democrat. When asked what he would do if he won the race, Buckley issued his classic response, "I'd demand a recount." (During one televised debate with Lindsay, Buckley declined to use his allotted rebuttal time and instead replied, "I am satisfied to sit back and contemplate my own former eloquence.")
To relieve traffic congestion, Buckley proposed charging cars a fee to enter the central city, and a network of bike lanes; such car-toll plans have recently been considered for New York City, but were blocked by the New York State legislature. He finished third with 13.4% of the vote, having unintentionally aided Lindsay's election by taking votes from Democratic candidate Abe Beame.
Buckley was not the first member of his family to run for a big-city mayoral position. His cousin Elliot Ross Buckley ran in 1962 as the Republican candidate for mayor of New Orleans but was easily defeated by the Democrat Victor Schiro. Elliot Buckley's New Orleans race was said to have paralleled and foreshadowed Bill Buckley's campaign three years later.
"Firing Line".
For many Americans, Buckley's erudite style on his weekly PBS show "Firing Line" (1966–1999)was their primary exposure to him. In it he displayed a scholarly, non-confrontational, and humorous conservatism and was known for his facial expressions, gestures and probing questions of his guests.
With his ability to engage on a wide range of subjects, Buckley was a favorite guest of Johnny Carson on "The Tonight Show". Carson considered him a friend and would introduce him as "Bill Buckley."
Throughout his career as a media figure, Buckley had received much criticism, largely from the American left but also from certain factions on the right, such as the John Birch Society, as well as from Objectivists.
Feud with Gore Vidal.
Buckley appeared in a series of televised debates with Gore Vidal during the 1968 Democratic Party convention. In their penultimate debate on August 28 of that year, the two disagreed over the actions of the Chicago police and the protesters at the ongoing Democratic Convention in Chicago. After Buckley responded to Vidal's argument by stating that Vidal's position was "so naive" and referring to protesters as "some people were pro-Nazi," Vidal called Buckley a “Crypto-Nazi," ("cf.", Crypto-fascism) to which Buckley replied, “Now listen, you queer, stop calling me a crypto-Nazi or I will sock you in your goddamn face, and you will stay plastered.”
This feud continued the following year in the pages of "Esquire Magazine", which commissioned an essay from both Buckley and Vidal on the television incident. Buckley's essay "On Experiencing Gore Vidal," was published in the August 1969 issue, and led Vidal to sue for libel. The court threw out Vidal's case. Vidal's September essay in reply, "A Distasteful Encounter with William F. Buckley," was similarly litigated by Buckley. Vidal also strongly implied that, in 1944, Buckley and unnamed siblings had vandalized a Protestant church in their Sharon, Connecticut, hometown after the pastor's wife had sold a house to a Jewish family. Buckley sued Vidal and "Esquire" for libel; Vidal counter-claimed for libel against Buckley, citing Buckley's characterization of Vidal's novel "Myra Breckenridge" as pornography. Both cases were dropped, with Buckley settling for court costs paid by Vidal, while Vidal absorbed his own court costs. Buckley also received an editorial apology in the pages of "Esquire" as part of the settlement.
The feud was re-opened in 2003 when Esquire re-published the original Vidal essay, at which time further legal action resulted in Buckley being compensated both personally and for his legal fees, along with editorial notice and apology in the pages of Esquire.
Spy novelist.
In 1975, In an interview in the Paris Review, Buckley recounted being inspired to write a spy novel by Frederick Forsyth's "The Day of the Jackal": "...If I were to write a book of fiction, I'd like to have a whack at something of that nature." He went on to explain that he was determined to avoid the moral ambiguity of Graham Greene and John Le Carré. Buckley wrote the 1976 spy novel "Saving the Queen", featuring Blackford Oakes as a rule-bound CIA agent; Buckley based the novel in part on his own CIA experiences. Over the next 30 years, Buckley would write another 10 novels featuring Oakes. "New York Times" critic Charlie Rubin wrote that the series "at its best, evokes John O'Hara in its precise sense of place amid simmering class hierarchies."
He was particularly concerned about the view that what the CIA and the KGB were doing were morally equivalent. As he wrote in his memoirs, "I said to Johnny Carson that to say that the CIA and the KGB engage in similar practices is the equivalent of saying that the man who pushes an old lady into the path of a hurtling bus is not to be distinguished from the man who pushes an old lady out of the path of a hurtling bus: on the grounds that, after all, in both cases someone is pushing old ladies around.
Later career.
Buckley participated in an ABC live and very heated debate with scientist Carl Sagan, following the airing of "The Day After", a 1983 made-for-television movie about the effects of nuclear war. Sagan argued against nuclear proliferation, while Buckley, a staunch anti-communist, promoted the concept of nuclear deterrence. During the debate, Sagan discussed the concept of nuclear winter and made his famous analogy, equating the arms race to "two sworn enemies standing waist-deep in gasoline, one with three matches, the other with five."
In 1988 Buckley was instrumental in the defeat of liberal Republican Senator Lowell Weicker. Buckley organized a committee to campaign against Weicker and endorsed his Democratic opponent, Connecticut Attorney General Joseph Lieberman Lieberman defeated Weicker by only about 10,000 votes, with critical margins coming from conservative areas of the state that strongly backed George H.W. Bush for President.
In 1991, Buckley received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George H. W. Bush. Buckley retired as active editor from "National Review" in 1990, and relinquished his controlling shares of "National Review" in June 2004 to a pre-selected board of trustees. The following month he published the memoir "Miles Gone By". Buckley continued to write his syndicated newspaper column, as well as opinion pieces for "National Review" magazine and National Review Online. He remained editor-at-large at the magazine and also conducted lectures, granted occasional radio interviews and made guest appearances on national television news programs.
Views on modern-day conservatism.
Buckley had recently criticized certain aspects of policy within the modern conservative movement. Of George W. Bush's presidency, he said, "If you had a European prime minister who experienced what we’ve experienced it would be expected that he would retire or resign." He has said, "Bush is conservative, but he is not a conservative", and that the president was not elected "as a vessel of the conservative faith." Regarding the War in Iraq, Buckley stated, "The reality of the situation is that missions abroad to effect regime change in countries without a bill of rights or democratic tradition are terribly arduous." He added: "This isn't to say that the Iraq war is wrong, or that history will judge it to be wrong. But it is absolutely to say that conservatism implies a certain submission to reality; and this war has an unrealistic frank and is being conscripted by events." In a February 2006 column published at National Review Online and distributed by Universal Press Syndicate, Buckley stated unequivocally that, "One cannot doubt that the American objective in Iraq has failed." Buckley has also stated that "...it's important that we acknowledge in the inner councils of state that it (the war) has failed, so that we should look for opportunities to cope with that failure."
Over the course of his career, Buckley's views changed on some issues, such as drug legalization, which he came to favor. In his December 3 2007 column, Buckley seemingly advocated banning tobacco use in America.
About neoconservatives, he said in 2004: "I think those I know, which is most of them, are bright, informed and idealistic, but that they simply overrate the reach of U.S. power and influence."
Death.
Buckley died at his home in Stamford, Connecticut on February 27, 2008, at age 82; he was found dead at his desk in the study of the home. "He died with his boots on," his son said, "after a lifetime of riding pretty tall in the saddle." At the time of his death, he had been suffering from emphysema and diabetes.
Half a year ago my wife died, technically from an infection, but manifestly, at least in part, from a body weakened by 60 years of nonstop smoking. I stayed off the cigarettes but went to the idiocy of cigars inhaled, and suffer now from emphysema, which seems determined to outpace heart disease as a human killer. Stick me in a confessional and ask the question: Sir, if you had the authority, would you forbid smoking in America? You'd get a solemn and contrite, Yes.
Notable members of the Republican political establishment paying tribute to Buckley included President George W. Bush, former Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich, and former First Lady Nancy Reagan. Bush said of Buckley, "[h]e influenced a lot of people, including me. He captured the imagination of a lot of people." Gingrich added, "Bill Buckley became the indispensable intellectual advocate from whose energy, intelligence, wit, and enthusiasm the best of modern conservatism drew its inspiration and encouragement... Buckley began what led to Senator Barry Goldwater and his Conscience of a Conservative that led to the seizing of power by the conservatives from the moderate establishment within the Republican Party. From that emerged Ronald Reagan." Reagan's widow, Nancy commented, "Ronnie valued Bill's counsel throughout his political life, and after Ronnie died, Bill and Pat were there for me in so many ways."
Language expertise.
Buckley was well known for his command of language. Buckley came late to formal instruction in the English language, not learning it until he was seven years old (his first language was Spanish, learned in Mexico, and his second French, learned in Paris). As a consequence, he spoke English with an idiosyncratic accent: something between an old-fashioned, upper class Mid-Atlantic accent and British Received Pronunciation. Impressionist David Frye included Buckley in his portfolio in the 1960s and 1970s, mastering Buckley's quirky mannerisms, such as his deliberate speech pattern, his use of pen or pencil as a prop, and his tendency to grin and open his eyes wide when making a self-satisfying verbal point.
