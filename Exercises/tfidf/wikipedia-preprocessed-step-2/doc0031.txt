Assault rifle.
An assault rifle is a selective fire rifle or carbine firing ammunition with muzzle energies intermediate between those typical of pistol and battle rifle ammunition. Assault rifles are categorized between light machine guns, intended more for sustained automatic fire in a support role, and submachine guns, which fire a handgun cartridge rather than a rifle cartridge. Assault rifles are the standard small arms in most modern armies, having largely replaced or supplemented larger, more powerful battle rifles, such as the World War II-era M1 Garand and Tokarev SVT. Examples of assault rifles include the AK-47 and the M16 rifle. Semi-automatic rifles, including commercial versions of the AR-15, and "automatic" rifles limited to firing single shots, even though incorrectly classified as assault rifles by the now defunct 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, are not assault rifles as they are not selective fire. Belt-fed weapons or rifles with very limited capacity fixed magazines are also generally not considered assault rifles.
Definition.
The term "assault rifle" is a translation of the German word "Sturmgewehr" (literally meaning "storm rifle"), "storm" used as a verb being synonymous with assault, as in "to storm the compound". Sturmgewehr was coined by Adolf Hitler to describe the Maschinenpistole 44, subsequently re-christened Sturmgewehr 44, the firearm generally considered the first true assault rifle and served to popularize the concept.
There are commentators who use the expression “assault rifle” more loosely to include other types of arms, particularly arms that fall under a strict definition of the battle rifle, or civilian semi-automatic off-shoots of military rifles for commercial or political reasons. Some militaries of nations outside of the English-speaking world also have a different definition of assault rifle. For instance, the analogous term in the Swedish Armed Forces is "automatkarbin" (literally "automatic carbine") which includes both assault rifles and battle rifles.
The changing face of infantry combat.
From ancient times, light infantry had fought in dispersed formations, while heavy infantry had fought in tightly packed formations. This continued as the sling and spear were replaced by musket and bayonet. Bright colored uniforms (German: Blue, Russian: Green; British: Red, French: White) became a standard for unit cohesion in the midst of clouds of black powder smoke. Muskets were inaccurate at distances greater than 50 to 100 meters, and multiple ranks and a reserve were necessary so that some part of the unit would be ready to fire at all times. Tight formations also aided officers in controlling their men during combat.
The adaptation of rifled muskets for military use in the mid-19th century increased range and firepower and made battle from dense formations an increasingly bloody affair as witnessed by the high level of casualties in the American Civil War. Skirmisher tactics were given greater emphasis as gunpowder weapons increased in reliability, accuracy, and rate of fire. Cavalry adapted by dismounting, and using skirmisher tactics with breechloading rifles (which could be reloaded from a prone position, reducing vulnerability to enemy fire).
After the American Civil War, further developments such as the adaptation of magazine-fed rifles, rapid fire machine guns and high explosive shells for the artillery, spelled the end of the dense infantry formation during World War I. What this meant in practice was that infantry units no longer engaged each other at long range in open fields; the high power of relatively unwieldy bolt-action rifles of the day (which had been tripled by the adaptation of smokeless powder, along with a corresponding increase in recoil and report) was no longer suited to the close range engagement of modern warfare. Military leaders and arms manufacturers thus began grasping for a new type of weapon for this new era.
1900s–1930s: Pre-Sturmgewehr Light automatic rifles.
"These automatic firearms tended to use used pre-existing rifle cartridges, kinetic energy ranged between 3,000–5,000 J (2,200–3,700-foot-pounds), velocities of 750–900 s (2,460–2,950 ft/s) and bullets of 9 to 13 g (139–200 grains)."
If the term is applied retroactively, the first assault rifle was the Italian-made Cei-Rigotti, which was developed in the 1890s and finished around 1900. While tested in Italy and the United Kingdom, it never entered military service, however. The first service assault rifle was the Russian Fedorov Avtomat issued for the first time in 1915, chambered for the Japanese 6.5x50mm Arisaka rifle cartridge, which was only used in small numbers.
During World War I the French Chauchat was introduced, an automatic rifle that was produced in large numbers (250,000). Like the later assault rifle it was capable of both single and automatic fire, and was loaded with a magazine and also featured a pistol grip. Compared to other light machine guns of the time the Chauchat was fairly light at the weight of but it was still too cumbersome for closer quarters and had recoil that was too heavy to control when firing fully automatic due to the use of full powered rifle rounds like original French chambering of the 8 mm Lebel (8x50mmR) or variants produced later for US forces in 30-06 and other international customers in and rifle calibers. Despite some serious flaws it was so important to infantry combat that desperate German troops who had no comparable weapon of their own started using captured Chauchats. While it was chambered for 30-06 and therefore did not use an intermediate cartridge, it was an intermediate weapon between submachine guns and heavier machine guns such as the Lewis Gun.
The Ribeyrolle 1918 may be the first real select fire compact weapon using an intermediate round fitting today's definition of an assault rifle. The cartridge was based on the 351 Winchester Self loading case necked down to accept a 8 mm Lebel bullet. it was first introduced to the Army Technical Service on July, 6th, 1918. its official designation was Carabine Mitrailleuse (English: Machine Carbine. German: Maschinenkarabiner) It was finally rejected in 1921 because it was not enough accurate over 400 meters.
The American M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) copied the Chauchat concept in a more reliable design but was not introduced or used in any significant numbers before the war ended. Later developments added heavier barrels and bipods that made it more like today's light machine gun or squad automatic weapon, though it did help establish the doctrine of use for light selective fire rifles. These versions of the BAR were produced in large numbers, widely adopted, and served into the 1960s with the U.S. military and other nations.
Also during World War I, submachine guns also entered service such as the Villar Perosa, the Beretta Model 1918 and the MP18. These weapons fired cartridges derived from pistol chamberings — 9 mm Glisenti and 9 mm Parabellum. The developers of the Thompson submachine gun (also developed during the 1910s) originally intended to use rifle-powered rounds. However, a mechanical system that could handle their power was not found and the .45 ACP cartridge was chosen instead. These firearms are considered part of the submachine gun class, but were an important step in the development of assault rifles.
1930s: Automatic intermediate weapons.
The M1 Carbine was really a cross between a submachine gun and an assault rifle, but giving infantry men a reliable weapon with moderate stopping power.Continuing evolution of the intermediate-caliber automatic rifle was primarily driven by ammunition. Handgun ammunition used by submachine guns limited in effective range. Conversely, full-sized military rifle calibers were uncomfortable to fire repeatedly and difficult to control during fully automatic or rapid fire because of significant recoil; cost of design and manufacture was also higher. One attempt to combine an intermediate cartridge with an automatic rifle by the Italian arms company Beretta resulted in the MAB 38 ("Moschetto Automatico Beretta 1938"). The MAB 38 used a Fiocchi "9M38" cartridge and a higher-powered Parabellum cartridge, which could provide longer range fire. The effective range was about.
In 1942, the United States introduced the M1 Carbine, which was an intermediate power weapon chambered for the .30 Carbine cartridge. While select-fire capability was initially planned for the M1 Carbine, this was dropped from the first version. Later in the war, selective fire variants were made (M2 and M3 Carbines). The weapon had greater range and accuracy than submachine guns, but was not as powerful as full-size automatic rifles such as the Browning Automatic Rifle. The longer barrel (18-inch) provided the carbine with higher muzzle velocity than pistols and submachine guns chambered for the same.30 round. (The.30 Carbine round was also lower powered, in terms of muzzle energy, than its contemporary, the German 7.92.x33 round, or more modern assault rifle rounds.)
Originally the Carbine was envisioned as an inexpensive lightweight weapon for issue to rear-area and support troops (truckers, tankers, cooks, etc.) in place of the more expensive M1911 pistol or M1 Garand rifle. The M1 Carbine series was soon found suitable for close quarter battle engagements, a concept that would be re-applied later. In particularly, it was furnished to US Airborne divisions, because of the expectation that Airborne units would have to fight without being resupplied. This marked the first time in which such an intermediate weapon would be mass-produced — it became the most produced American weapon of the war, with millions made. The M1 Carbine series would remain in service with the U.S. military primary forces until supplemented and finally replaced by the M16 rifle in the 1960s; it continued to be used limited roles—particularly the U.S. Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and many Training Commands in various U.S. Armed forces well into the 1980s—as well as used in other nations (notably Israel, where it is still used frequently in a variety of forms).
The 1930s was also the beginning of the important German "Maschinenkarabiner" program of arms development that resulted in the prototype Maschinenkarabiner M35 that was however not adopted for service.
1940s–early 1950s: Maschinenkarabiner, Sturmgewehr & AK-47.
"Some of these automatic firearms used pre-existing rounds; others used new intermediate cartridges. Kinetic energy ranged between 1,400–2,100 J (1,033–1,550-foot-pounds), muzzle velocities of 600–800m/s (1,970–2,625 ft/s) and bullets of 7–9g (108–139 grains)."
Germany, under the Versailles Treaty was limited to a professional army of long service soldiers numbering only 100,000 men and forbade tanks or military aircraft. This encouraged an approach that emphasized high quality, and reduced emphasis on low cost. Infantry tactics became based on teams of General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMG) supporting and supported by a section of infantry. GPMG had high rates of fire to permit small numbers of men to fire at long range to defend a wide front. Enemy soldiers, briefly exposed, would be engaged with a high rate burst of fire to cause casualties before they could take cover. Close range assaults would be conducted by units with submachine guns, for greater mobility, and higher rates of fire. This tactical approach was a refinement of the "Hutier" tactics used by Germany in the last year of WWI.
Germany, like other countries, had observed and studied the emerging demand of infantry rifles evolving since World War I, and their factories made a variety of non-standard cartridges, therefore having less incentive to retain their existing calibers. The 7.92x30 mm (Kurz) cartridge was an example of these experiments; in 1941, it was improved to 7.92x33mm Kurz "Infanterie Kurz Patrone" ("Infantry Short Cartridge"). In 1942, it was again improved as "Maschinenkarabiner Patrone S", and in 1943, "Pistolen Patrone 43mE"; then, finally, "Infanterie Kurz Patrone 43". The similarity in size between the 7.92x33mm German cartridge and the 7.62x33mm developed for the M1 Carbine is a curious coincidence, but was ultimately nothing more than independent yet similar solutions to the same problem. The 7.92x33mm round used the same cartridge case head as the standard 7.92x57mm Mauser and the bullet was made from the same diameter rod.
In 1942, Walther presented the "Maschinenkarabiner" ("automatic carbine", abbr. MKb), named MKb42(W). In the same year, Haenel presented the MKb42(H), designed by Hugo Schmeisser as a result of this program. Rheinmetall-Borsig (some said Krieghoff) presented its FG 42 ("Fallschirmjäger Gewehr 42", sponsored by Hermann Göring) though this was in a different role, and using a heavy 7.92x57mm Mauser cartridge, which was not an intermediate round. War-time tests in Russia indicated the MKb42(H) performed better than the other two. Schmeisser developed it first as the MP43, then MP43/1, and finally as the MP44/Sturmgewehr 44 (abbreviated StG44). It immediately entered large scale production. More than 5,000 units had been produced by February 1944, and 55,000 by the following November.
Following the end of the war in 1947, Mikhail Kalashnikov developed the AK-47, which was vaguely similar in visual concept and layout to the German StG44, though quite different mechanically. It fired the 7.62x39mm cartridge, which had been developed during WWII for use in their SKS carbines which were used at war's end. The round was similar to the StG44's in that the bullet was of a similar caliber to the larger, full-size Russian rifle ammunition.
The designers of the STG 45 moved to Spain and developed the CETME Assault Rifle, which was licensed for use in West Germany, and was subsequently improved to become the German G-3, produced by Heckler and Koch HK. proved the CETME, This is where H&K started.
Late 1950s–1960s: Lighter rifles & smaller bullets.
"Many of these automatic firearms used intermediate cartridges with much lighter bullets and smaller calibers, but fired at very high velocity; kinetic energy ranged between 1300–1800J (960–1,330-foot-pounds), velocities of 900–1050m/s (2,950–3,450 ft/s), and bullets of 3–4g (46–62 grains)."
After WWII and the creation of NATO, the United States insisted on introducing their own 7.62x51mm full-power cartridge (developed from the 30-06/7.62x63mm - American standard during WWII) as standard in NATO. It could kill at distances of more than 500 meters, although statistical studies of WWII battles performed by the U.S. Army revealed that infantry combat beyond 300 meters (325 yards) was rare. At the time, the British were developing their own 7x43mm (.280 British) intermediate cartridge for their very modern and groundbreaking EM-2 bull-pup assault rifle. Due to political pressure from the Conservative Party, which agreed with the American standardization campaign, the whole project was shelved at the eve of introduction. In Belgium, the famous arms producer FN Herstal started experimenting with the German 7.92x33mm Kurzpatrone. They built a prototype of a rifle using this cartridge, but the impending NATO standardization forced them to rebuild it to use American ammo, giving birth to the FN FAL, Switzerland introduced the SIG 510 that still fired Swiss service full-lengh rifle rounds but also produced the SIG 510-4 that fired the 7.62x51mm NATO round. Bolivia and Chile adopted the SIG 510-4 as their service rifle, Bolivian/Chilean exports were licence produced by the Italian firm Berreta.
The M14 rifle, chambered for the 7.62x51mm NATO (more commonly known as the.308 round among civilians), had a very high recoil, due to the weapons powerful cartridge, and this made it almost impossible to control the M14 in full automatic fire. They found that the weapon recoiled both up and back, putting you off your target very quickly. This was fixed by making the stock straight, so that it only recoiled back, minimizing your needs to re-aim after each shot or burst of fully automatic fire. They made a new cartridge to go with this weapon: the 5.56x45mm NATO. The small cartridge made for doubts among the armed forces, and they questioned the rifle's stopping power. But, they were soon proved wrong. After some study, they found that the 5.56mm bullet, after entering the body, started to tumble,rolling end over end, creating massive damage.They christened their new rifle the M16. But soon after the rifle was the standard weapon to all the US armed forces, they saw that the M16 had a very high tendency to jam, making it unsuitable for jungle warfare, They later found that the jamming was because of improper care and cleaning. This was soon fixed by making a soldiers rifle his foremost thing to take care of and watch out for.
The Russians saw no reason to make a rifle that shot beyond a rifleman's ability to aim, and therefore considered a lighter, less-powerful cartridge to be more effective. This permitted a lighter rifle and allowed a greater amount of the lighter ammunition to be transported in the same amount of space. Moreover, the smaller cartridges lessened recoil, which allowed riflemen to sustain a higher accurate rate of fire and facilitate marksmanship training. In addition, the smaller size and handiness of an assault rifle would benefit tank crews, support troops, and units with missions other than front line combat.
The 5.56x45mm with 55 grain bullet, aka M193 cartridge) was developed in the late 1950s, and was adopted for use in the M16 assault rifle. The M16A1 version soon followed to rectify issues found during use in the Vietnam War. The M16A2 was a further refinement and upgrade introduced in 1986 meant to use the Belgian-updated 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge with a heavier 62 grain bullet known as the SS109 or M855.
The smaller-caliber military cartridges such as the 5.56x45mm and 5.45x39mm were sometimes considered less lethal than the previous generation of assault rifle rounds, such as the 7.62x39mm, which were large-caliber bullets with reduced propellant or cases. However, the lighter, small-caliber bullets achieved higher velocities, more favorable ballistic properties, and reduced carrying weight.
One aspect of the smaller caliber ammunition that is sometimes hotly debated is its fragmentation behavior. Stopping capability is the effectiveness of the round in completely stopping the target when it hits — either killing or fully incapacitating. Within a certain range of ballistic conditions, the lighter and will, upon striking tissue, first tumble and then fragment. Beyond 100 yards, or when fired from shorter barrels, such bullets can often fail to fragment upon impact because of insufficient velocity. Thus, the result in a target is a rather small.22 caliber bullet hole, instead of a much larger wound channel. Effectiveness depends on what tissues of the enemy body the round destroys. Larger destroyed areas increases the probability that sufficient damage will be done to end enemy resistance. Ultimately, any pointed (spitzer) round will tumble in soft tissue. If the jacket has a cannelure, such as the U.S. 5.56x45mm M193 round, and the bullet is in the proper ballistic state and high enough velocity, the bullet will fragment, inflicting significant blood loss and internal damage, as well as a wound channel profile that is more complex to address medically. If the bullet acts as a solid, and doesn't fragment, full effectiveness occurs only if striking the brain or spinal cord, causing immediate loss of control. There is a distinct, though lesser effectiveness if the heart, large blood vessels, or liver (which last tends to tear) is hit causing fairly quick loss of blood pressure, and consequent unconsciousness.
Part of the dispute over small-caliber rounds arises here. Blood loss leads to indirect incapacitation, but often takes longer than direct destruction of tissue. A pervasive but false urban myth holds that Defense Secretary Robert McNamara presented wounding ability as a reason for adoption of the M16 over the M14. Many claim that the theory that wounding one soldier will take him out of action was wed to the findings of Project SALVO, but the reality is that nowhere in the SALVO findings was reduced lethality of rifle rounds ever stressed or presented as an argument for adoption of a lighter/smaller caliber round. SALVO concluded that the main factor in inflicting casualties in infantry combat was solely rounds fired — aiming had negligible impact. Initial findings from combat trials with Special Forces and the ARVN units they advised in Vietnam actually indicated that ammunition was somewhat (11%) "more" lethal than 7.62x51 M59/M80 type full-metal jacket ammunition.
The general effectiveness of the 5.56x45mm cartridge was questioned; experience had shown that it did not always fragment, and that the bullet was light enough to easily deflect or divert radically from its path after passing through even a soft or very thin object. The heavier bullets in use were claimed by some to hit harder with more mass, would not deflect or destabilize as readily, and more reliably killed what it hit. These claims appear to have been largely, if not wholly, anecdotal, however, with little statistical evidence from after-action reviews and other post-combat surveys of troops. The idea that a heavier bullet must, inherently, be more lethal seems sufficiently logical that many take it as an accepted fact regardless of actual fact.
While the debate about the effectiveness of the 5.56/5.45 mm bullet versus the continued, some interesting developments did arise in the following generation of weapons.
1970s–1990s: New form factors, features & battlefield.
"Many of these automatic firearms usually used the same rounds as in older eras, but focused on using new form factors, materials, and added features like standard telescopic and reflex sights."
The running debate over vs. ammunition, and the prominent argument by proponents that "the Russians got it right with a.30 cal (7.62 mm)" cartridge, was stirred significantly in 1974 when the Soviet Union also developed its own smaller-caliber cartridge, the 5.45x39mm, which was used in the AK-74, the successor of the AK-47/AKM.
In the 1980s and 1990s, the most notable changes since adoption of high velocity, smaller-caliber ammunition were designs that utilized new form factors, sights, electronics, and materials, as well as modularity. A number of bullpup rifles entered service in the late 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Although bullpup rifles had existed since the 1930s, the United Kingdom's EM-2 was one of the few bullpup assault rifles prior to this time. Examples of the new trend include the FAMAS, Steyr AUG, and SA80. All three are bullpup rifles that make heavy use of composites and plastics, the FAMAS and Steyr AUG both have ambidextrous controls, and the Steyr AUG, and SA80 both added a low-power telescopic sight to the standard service version. The QBZ-95, SAR-21, and the Tavor TAR-21 follow a similar trend as well, with a bullpup configuration and heavy use of composites.
The Heckler & Koch G36, adopted in the late 1990s by Spain and Germany, is of the traditional configuration, but also has integral telescopic and red dot sights and composite exterior. The G36C variant uses a different barrel assembly, foregrip, and a slightly shorter folding stock to make the weapon carbine length, and features a low full-length rail mount along the top of the rifle in place of the carrying handle and sight assembly, plus shorter rails on the foregrip. The XM8 rifle, developed from the G36, had similar features, but also added more electronics such as laser sight, round counter, and integral infrared laser and pointers.
Through the 1990s, modular accessories for use on rifles, of a variety of types, started to become widespread with the rapidly increasing practice of mounting Picatinny-style rails on firearms. This was primarily driven by the growing visibility (and number) of tactical police, counter-terrorist units, special forces, and other groups that desired the capability to specifically tailor their weapons — be it to the situation at hand, their operational specialty, etc. Flashlights, visible lasers, infrared lights and lasers, ergonomic accessories such as vertical foregrips and folding or collapsible buttstocks, and a plethora of other options appeared. Many law enforcement and tactical groups, including some of the most influential, also contributed to the progression by shifting from using submachine guns to very compact assault rifles, usually with small-caliber (5.56 mm) ammunition.
Intertwined with the growth of the modular accessories was the concept of rifles being modular themselves. The G36, for example, can be converted to a compact carbine, a standard rifle, or a squad support weapon (light machine gun) and back again simply by swapping modular parts in a matter of moments. Interchangeable or quick-detachable barrel assemblies of different lengths are emerging for some weapons, with ingenious retrofit kits to provide similar capabilities on older types. The AR15 in particular has an entire industry that has grown to make variations of every component of the rifle. An incredible variety of upper receivers of many types of operation (bolt, direct gas impingement, gas piston, blowback) utilizing different ammunition than the original 5.56x45mm have been developed, firing both pistol and rifle cartridges ranging between target rounds such as.17 and.22 Rimfire, pistol rounds of.380 ACP to.50 AE, and more common assault rifle rounds such as 7.62x51mm, all the way up to heavy machine gun rounds such as the .50 BMG. In a paradox many never expected, an AK variant has been developed that fires the 5.56x45mm round, while a variant of the M4 carbine (a compact M16) has been created that can use AK-47 magazines and its 7.62x39mm ammunition.
The trend in the new designs, and very likely future ones, is towards more integrated features and lighter weight with new materials and configurations. Introduction of a new ammunition would require retooling factories, phasing out conventional ammunition, and making general infrastructure changes that are considered by many military planners to be too expensive to undertake. In an effort to avoid the problems of a completely new cartridge, the 77-grain Mk262 Mod0 bullet for the 5.56x45mm chambering, developed to address continuing issues in some cases with the effectiveness of the round, has started to gain acceptance.
Since the adoption of the M16 over the M14, some groups of shooting pundits have supported the return to, or reintroduction of, larger caliber rounds — usually the 7.62x51mm NATO specifically, which is made to perform like the full-sized 30-06 in an assault-rifle sized cartridge. Going back to the, it is argued, would improve conventional lethality. Other individuals have suggested an increase in caliber, to the 6–7 mm range, with rifle round velocities and lower mass bullets: a kind of intermediate philosophy between the smaller caliber–faster modern rounds and the standard caliber–slower rounds of the previous generation. China in the late 1980s introduced a 5.8x42mm round, with an initial velocity of /s, bullet and 1,842 J of energy, China claims the new round provides superior performance and lethality to NATO (5.56x45mm) and modern Soviet (5.45x39mm) intermediate rounds.
A promising development of the German Heckler & Koch G11 rifle caseless ammunition and advanced assault rifle in the 1970–1980s was effectively halted by German reunification and heat-dissipation issues with the caseless ammunition in 1990, and the rifle never entered full production.
21st Century Developments: The first decade: Shorter barrels, larger bullets, more energy.
A renaissance of weapons has begun to occur recently. To some degree in Iraq, but particularly in Afghanistan, soldiers are beginning to use modernized M14s, M21s, and M24 SWS. With a longer effective range, the 7.62x51mm is proving useful at fighting at long ranges. The 7.62x51 NATO round has also shown its usefulness against enemies who have been seen to take several hits from bullets and not be killed, incapacitated, or on occasion, even deterred. That unpleasant surprise is attributed to long-range ballistic deficiencies of the 5.56 bullet. Similar stopping-power problems against unusually-tenacious opponents were noticed in Somalia in 1993 against militia fighters high on khat. Lastly, the heavier rounds are more effective in urban combat because they can more readily penetrate walls.
In the United States there have been developments of new cartridges. Two have developed some notability as possible replacements for the venerable 5.56, the 6.5 Grendel and the SPC. Remington has developed the 6.8 mm Remington SPC cartridge, which has the same cartridge overall length (COAL) as the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge but fires the larger.270 caliber bullets. Likewise, Alexander Arms at Radford Arsenal developed the 6.5 Grendel cartridge, which combines long range accuracy comparable to the NATO with close range stopping power similar to the 6.8 SPC. With both bullets, by matching the 5.56's COAL, conversion of existing AR-15, M4 and M16 rifles requires only replacement of uppers and magazines. Other cartridges have been developed for the AR-15 platform such as the .50 Beowulf and the.458 Socom - but these cartridges are much heavier and relegated to a specialty role rather than as a pure assault rifle cartridge.
In addition to these new designs, the future may well be the redesign of the past. Recently, weapons manufacturing giants Heckler and Koch redesigned the M4 assault rifle. The new weapon, the HK416, has updated features. The include: a piston action, not gas, the bolt is sealed from the action, reducing dirt, heat and chance of failure, 1913 Picatinny rails, drop free magazine release and other subtle, but useful additions. These and other redesigns are quickly pushing it to the top of the ladder.
The future.
Small arms technology including the assault rifle can be described as a mature technology, meaning that no major technology changes can be expected in this area. However, minor improvements can still be expected that make the assault rifle more effective and efficient to accommodate the changes on the battlefield. Diminishing the effect of the assault rifle are improvements to personal body armor, which allow it to stop or hinder bullet penetration from intermediate caliber small arms.
As weapons evolve, the delicate balance for assault rifle systems between power, weight, recoil and terminal effects will likely shift once again in an attempt to defeat body armor, to match the range of full-power cartridges, and to penetrate through windshields and thin-skinned vehicles while still producing good terminal effects. Possible future directions are armor piercing or exploding tip bullets or saboted sub-caliber tungsten darts, more powerful cartridges, carbon fiber barrels and exotic metals such as titanium and scandium.
Assault weapons vs. Automatic weapons==.
A common public misconception persists that the assault weapons ban restricted weapons capable of fully automatic fire, such as assault rifles and machine guns. Fully automatic weapons, however, were unaffected by the ban, and have been continuously and heavily regulated since the National Firearms Act of 1934 was passed. Subsequent laws such as the Gun Control Act of 1968 and the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 also affected the importation and civilian ownership of fully automatic firearms, the latter fully prohibiting sales of newly-manufactured machine guns to non-law enforcement or SOT(Special occupancy Tax) dealers.
