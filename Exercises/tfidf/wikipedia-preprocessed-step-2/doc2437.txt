William Monahan.
William Monahan () (born November 3, 1960) is an American screenwriter, literary novelist, and former journalist. After attending the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, where he studied Elizabethan and Jacobean drama, Monahan, already a professional writer while an undergraduate, as well as a musician in Northampton, Massachusetts, moved to New York City to pursue a career as a journalist, writer and critic. He wrote many satirical pieces for "New York Press", a few reviews for "The New York Post", and contributed to the magazines "Talk", "Maxim", and "Bookforum". He was also an editor at "Spy" magazine. He won a 1997 Pushcart Prize when the Amherst literary magazine "Old Crow Review" nominated one of his short stories. After "Spy" failed, he concentrated on writing films and he wrote ', his first novel, which garnered praise from critics.
Monahan went to work in Hollywood in 1998, when Warner Bros. bought the film rights to "Light House: A Trifle" while it was still in manuscript, and contracted him to adapt it to the screen for director Gore Verbinski. In 2001, 20th Century Fox bought Monahan's spec script about the Barbary Wars called "Tripoli", with Ridley Scott, who was to become Monahan's primary collaborator, attached to direct. Monahan has since worked with Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg, among other filmmakers. His first produced screenplay, "Kingdom of Heaven" was made into a film by Ridley Scott and released to theaters in 2005. His second produced screenplay was "The Departed", a film which earned him a WGA award and an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.
Monahan prefers that screenplays be written by one writer rather than a collaboration of multiple screenwriters writing competing drafts. Thus far he has followed his scripts through production. In 2006, Monahan started his own production company, Henceforth, and negotiated a "first-look" producing deal with Warner Bros. Monahan currently resides on the North Shore of Massachusetts with his wife and two children.
Early years.
Monahan was born in Boston, Massachusetts to an Irish-American family and was raised Catholic. He spent his early years in the neighborhood of Roslindale, eventually moving to the suburbs of Boston at age six when his parents divorced. Over the years he frequently moved, living in many of the suburban communities on the North Shore of Massachusetts with his mother and sister. His father worked as an engineer and lived in the neighborhood of West Roxbury. Monahan regularly visited, and immersed himself in his father's extensive book collection; he particularly enjoyed reading Shakespeare's plays. His interest in movies began at age seven, when it occurred to him that a screenwriter was behind the story in "Lawrence of Arabia"; he wrote his first screenplay at age twelve.
While attending the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Monahan studied Elizabethan and Jacobean drama, and began a literary career, publishing in the small presses and zines emerging in the Pioneer Valley. His first published piece was a short story titled "At the Village Hall" appearing in 1991 in the Northampton zine "Perkins Press". Two years later, his first novel "Light House" was published serially in the Amherst literary magazine "Old Crow Review" in five installments; seven years after the first installment, it was eventually released as a book by Riverhead Books under the title '. When Kurt Vonnegut visited the campus as part of the university's Distinguished Visitors Program, Monahan attended the event as a writer for "Old Crow Review" and questioned Vonnegut; he later published an account of the experience in a "New York Press" piece titled "And Slow It Goes". At one point during his university years, Monahan entered into a short-lived business partnership with a lady interested in bookmaking (whom he had met when he crashed his motorcycle in front of her car) to print a slate of 100 paperback copies of a short novella he had written titled "Jejeune"; he quickly reconsidered the undertaking and bought out his partner, burning "all the copies but one".
Musician.
In the late 1980s Monahan was a musician playing guitar in a band called the Slags; they performed in and around Northampton, Massachusetts before breaking up. A few years later, he was a guitarist and a song-writer in another band called Foam which produced a demo tape. Monahan was also acquainted with Mike Ruffino, a writer and a bassist for The Unband, whom he hired as his assistant when he was editor of "Hamptons" magazine.
Man of letters.
In 1993 Monahan began contributing essays, short fiction, and cover stories to the alternative weekly newspaper "New York Press", which generated a favorable response from readers. However, gradually reactions from readers became polarized, often expressing outrage as "New York Press" published numerous satirical articles by Monahan in 1995, including "The Angel Factory", "Heroin", and "Dr. Rosenthal, I Presume" (See Reception). He even proposed a novel theory about the Unabomber's targeting methodology in one of his cover stories, titled "Ceci n'est pas une bombe", that was ultimately proven correct. Years later when Monahan was becoming an established screenwriter his peers looked back on his journalism and offered their own characterizations: former "New York Press" colleague Dawn Eden recalled him "as charming, libertarian-leaning, with a razor-sharp wit that he used in print to anger as many people as possible" and "Newsdays Jon Fine considered him to have been "an excellent and scabrous writer".
Monahan was hired to write a weekly column for "Hamptons" magazine throughout the summer season of 1995, on account of a scathing review of "Manhattan File" magazine he had written for "New York Press" in 1994, titled "Filed Away". The publisher of "Hamptons" magazine, a publication covering The Hamptons summer colony during the tourist season, had initially sought permission from Monahan to reprint his review, hoping to slander "Manhattan File" for personal reasons but Monahan declined permission; however, he accepted the offer of a weekly column and at the conclusion of its successful run he requested and was promoted to editor for the next year. Though his stint as editor of "Hamptons" in 1996 was brief. After editing three issues he quit, and several weeks later he wrote a cover story for "New York Press" titled "The Burning Deck: My Brilliant Career at "Hamptons", in which he described the workplace environment as chaotic and "ridiculously unworkable".
In late 1996, Monahan was awarded a 1997 Pushcart Prize for his short story, "A Relation of Various Accidents Observable in Some Animals Included in Vacuo", having been nominated in 1995 by the Amherst literary magazine "Old Crow Review"; the editor of "The Pushcart Prize", Bill Henderson, later provided a blurb for Monahan's first novel "Light House: A Trifle". In 1997, Monahan began freelancing for several publications in New York City, in addition to "New York Press". He earned some of his living reviewing books for "The New York Post", writing a review of Oliver Stone's first novel "A Child's Night Dream" in one instance, and contributed to the recently launched men's magazine "Maxim", a tremendously successful publication in its first years. He was also hired to work as an editor at "Spy" magazine, a satirical monthly, by the editor-in-chief Bruno Maddox; later in an interview with "The Boston Globe" he reminisced that he "had God's own job there". Unfortunately, in 1998, "Spy" magazine was shutdown; he had worked on the last four issues, rewriting the articles and improving the jokes, but was soon out of a job.
"Light House: A Trifle".

The failure of "Spy" magazine was only a brief setback for Monahan. Shortly thereafter, in 1998, he managed to rebound when he sold his first novel ' to Riverhead Books, a Penguin Group imprint. He had been working on the novel for several years, after its original serialization in "Old Crow Review", and had done a great deal of rewriting at the urging of his agent. He became a working screenwriter when Warner Bros. optioned the film rights while the novel was in manuscript and contracted Monahan to write the adaptation. Although he was spending time in the cities of San Francisco and Northampton, Massachusetts working on a script for "Light House", he still occasionally contributed to "New York Press" and even wrote an essay, on the depiction of Gloucester, Massachusetts in the movies, for "Talk" magazine's debut issue in August of 1999. Finally, in 2000, "Light House: A Trifle" was published; it garnered critical acclaim but had lackluster sales. William Georgiades, in a review for "The New York Times", called it "a sort of old English farce that allows Monahan [â€¦] to skewer whatever comes to mind: modern art, magazine writing, education, the young".
"BookPage Fiction'"s Bruce Tierney called Monahan "a worthy successor to Kingsley Amis", however, Claire Dederer, in an editorial review for Amazon.com, cautioned that "["Light House"] is not a novel for the culturally illiterate", and criticized the occasional inside-jokes that "[make] most sensible people very tired". The novel intentionally references the satirical novels of the early 19th century British author Thomas Love Peacock and tells the story of an artist named Tim Picasso who runs afoul of a drug lord and seeks refuge at a New England inn in the middle of a nor'easter.
In late 2001, Monahan wrote a comic serial narrative for "New York Press" titled "Dining Late with Claude La Badarian", published over thirteen weeks under the pseudonym Claude La Badarian, a fictional restaurant critic of "The Aristocrat" magazine. These short stories made satirical reference to his first novel and literary career. The "Dining Late with Claude La Badarian" column was described by a fictional Monahan, who entered the narrative occasionally, as "a blackmailed dining column written by a delusional media scumbag" intended as "a small yet integral part" of a forthcoming second novel. Each of the twelve columns that followed the initial proposal for the column contained a portrait of Claude La Badarian drawn by Antony Zito, a New York portrait painter and curator as well as Monahan's former band-mate in the Slags. At the conclusion of the serial, Monahan and Bruno Maddox went on a joint book tour that was interrupted by the 9/11 attacks. Shortly thereafter, Monahan sold his spec script "Tripoli" to 20th Century Fox, and was commissioned to write "Kingdom of Heaven" by Ridley Scott. He has apparently published no fiction since moving into film.
Screenwriting career.
Monahan's first film commission was the adaptation of his own novel, in 1998, with Gore Verbinski attached as director. Warner Bros. optioned the film rights to the unpublished manuscript for his satirical novel ', a deal which briefly gave them the exclusive right to purchase the copyright at a future date. Penguin Putnam subsequently delayed publishing "Light House: A Trifle" for a couple of years, so that they could release the novel alongside the film, however, the screenplay adaptation was never produced. Monahan continued working as a journalist, editing for "Details" magazine, and reviewing books for "Bookforum" magazine, but had committed to film writing. When "Light House" was finally released in 2000, Monahan had divested himself of any immediate interest in being a novelist. After less than four years in publication, "Light House: A Trifle" was taken off the market by Monahan while he was on location in Spain for the production of "Kingdom of Heaven"; he bought back the rights from the Penguin Group, later lamenting that it was "an empty, damaging gesture". "Light House" was available in a German edition translated by Ulrike Seeberger but went out-of-print.
"Tripoli".
In 1990, Monahan wrote a script titled "Tripoli", about William Eaton's epic march on Tripoli during the Barbary Wars, registering it with the WGA with the alternate title of "Captain Eaton", and later set out the opening of "Tripoli" in prose form under the title of "Romantic" in 1997, published in "Old Crow Review". While working at "Spy" magazine, Monahan routinely spent two weeks working in Manhattan followed by two weeks writing his own material in Massachusetts; during this period he took the "Tripoli" script out of a drawer and placed it with an agent. In 2001, shortly after he got married, "Tripoli" sold to 20th Century Fox, in a deal worth mid-six figures in American dollars with Mark Gordon attached as the producer. The historical epic follows Eaton's campaign against Yusuf Bashaw to restore Yusuf's brother, the exiled heir Hamet Karamanli, to the throne of the Barbary Coast nation of Tripoli, and features a French mercenary named Joubert. Ridley Scott signed to direct. Monahan met with Scott to discuss "Tripoli" and Scott mentioned his desire to direct a film about knights. Monahan suggested the fall of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem as a setting, and Ridley Scott and Fox commissioned Monahan to write the original screenplay which became "Kingdom of Heaven".
Negotiating deals and production rewriting.
In 2002, Monahan was hired by Universal Pictures to write the screenplay for "Jurassic Park IV"; he portrayed the kids in the script "like the ones in "Willy Wonka". When Monahan had to go on location for the production of "Kingdom of Heaven", John Sayles was hired to write the subsequent drafts. The next year, Columbia Pictures hired Monahan to adapt an unpublished manuscript by journalist Doug Stanton about the bloody uprising in the Afghan city Mazari Sharif after the recent American incursion against the Taliban; Stanton's novel had been optioned by producer Mace Neufeld.
As the January 2004 production of "Kingdom of Heaven" approached, Monahan negotiated a production write-through contract so that he could be present on the movie sets to make modifications to the shooting script. Additionally, Brad Pitt's production company Plan B hired him to write an adaptation of Hong Kong director Andrew Lau's gangster film "Infernal Affairs". Monahan adapted "Infernal Affairs" as a battle between Irish-American gangsters and cops in Boston's Southie district, with Martin Scorsese directing the completed screenplay under the title "The Departed" for Warner Bros.; the script later won him two Best Adapted Screenplay awards, from the Writers Guild of America and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
"Kingdom of Heaven" released to theaters.
While Monahan was on the set of "Kingdom of Heaven" his wife gave birth to a baby girl named Iris. He was already a step-father to his wife's son. Monahan managed to get two days off to spend with them. After production completed, Monahan was hired to collaborate once again with director Ridley Scott on an adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's ultra-violent Western novel "Blood Meridian" for producer Scott Rudin. In post-production on "Kingdom of Heaven", Scott edited a 3-hour long cut but decided to pare it down after it was discovered at a preview screening that the audience felt the film was too long; Scott was gradually convinced as well and settled on a 145-minute cut.
The months leading up to "Kingdom of Heavens theatrical release were troubled when author James Reston Jr. claimed that Monahan's "Kingdom of Heaven" script violated the copyright of his 2001 novel '. Reston claimed he had previously offered Ridley Scott the book for a movie deal but was turned down. He alleged that the entire second half of Monahan's shooting script was based on the first 105 pages of his book, and noted that "Kingdom of Heaven" is the title of the second chapter. 20th Century Fox denied all of Reston's claims and Monahan, in an e-mail, commented, "There was no infringement, period. I've been familiar with the fall of the Latin Kingdom for thirty-odd years." Reston did not pursue the matter and never filed a lawsuit.
In the meantime, Monahan had secured work on two Warner Bros. projects. He was hired to adapt Louis Begley's novel "Wartime Lies" for Warner Independent Pictures, previously in development as a Stanley Kubrick project called "Aryan Papers". A second script was to be based on Marco Polo's autobiography "Travels", as a star vehicle for actor Matt Damon, titled "The Venetian", and set during Polo's Far East explorations.
When "Kingdom of Heaven" was released theatrically in May 2005 it was poorly received by critics and was a box-office failure. Peter Canavese of "Groucho Reviews" described "Kingdom" as a "confusing compromise at best and a dull obfuscation of history at worst" and Jeffrey M. Anderson of "Combustible Celluloid" wrote that "Kingdom" "has at its center a bold story, and yet it sits there like a stone pillar". Ridley Scott later remarked that he got carried away with cutting the film in the editing room and learned that "the enemy is previews" because these test screenings are tantamount to asking an inexperienced group of people to be film critics. "Kingdom" was reappraised by critics when it was released on DVD in the form of a director's cut, containing an additional 45 minutes of footage previously shot from Monahan's shooting script. Critics were pleased with the extended version of the film and James Berardinelli of "ReelViews" remarked how "now that the director's cut is available, there's no reason for anyone to watch the neutered theatrical edition".
Best Adapted Screenplay Awards for "The Departed".
In 2006, Warner Bros. hired Monahan to adapt David Ignatius' novel "Body of Lies" into a film titled "Body of Lies", about a CIA operative who goes to Jordan to track a high-ranking terrorist, with Ridley Scott directing. Shortly afterwards, Monahan started a production company on the Warner Bros. lot called Henceforth and negotiated a first-look producing deal that gave the studio the first right of first refusal on any films produced by Henceforth. In return Henceforth received from Warner Bros. the film rights to produce John Pearson's true crime novel "The Gamblers", which Monahan adapted to the screen.
When Martin Scorsese's "The Departed" was released to theaters in October 2006, Monahan received considerable praise from critics and was applauded for accurately depicting the city of Boston. Monahan had chosen not to watch "Infernal Affairs" so that he could create an original interpretation of the Hong Kong action film, working from an English translation of the Chinese script, and had used his intimate knowledge of the way Bostonians talk and act, learned from his youth spent in the many neighborhoods of Boston, to create characters that "The Boston Globe" described as distinctly indigenous to the city.
"The Departed" won many critics' prizes. The "Los Angeles Times" reported that Monahan had hired a publicist to run a campaign promoting his screenplay during awards season, although he had in fact hired the publicity firm to manage relations with the studio involved, and had respectfully refused most publicity offers during the Awards Season, including an appearance on "The Charlie Rose Show"; he rarely does in-person interviews. He was honored by the US-Ireland Alliance for his writing in film and ended up winning two Best Adapted Screenplay awards for "The Departed", from the Writers Guild of America and from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He was later invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. As of 2007, he is working on a film treatment for a follow-up to "The Departed", which may be either a prequel or a sequel.
Taking on producing duties.
After winning the 2007 Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for "The Departed", it was announced that Monahan had been hired to work on two film projects: an adaptation of the Hong Kong film "Confession of Pain" and an original Rock and Roll film titled "The Long Play". Monahan signed to both executive produce and adapt the Hong Kong film "Confession of Pain" for Leonardo DiCaprio's production company Appian Way at Warner Bros. Pictures, his second adaptation of a Media Asia Films production created by directors Andrew Lau and Alan Mak and screenwriter Felix Chong. Monahan's other assignment was to rewrite a script titled "The Long Play", originally written in 1999 by "Rolling Stone" magazine writer Rich Cohen, who was hired by Mick Jagger and Scorsese to research and write the first drafts of a story about the history of the rock music business; in the intervening years Matthew Weiss, who wrote the screenplay for "Niagara, Niagara", did several rewrites of the original drafts. "The Long Play" was nurtured at Mick Jagger's production company Jagged Films. Martin Scorsese became involved while the film project was at Disney and negotiated a turnaround deal to bring "The Long Play" to Paramount.
In 2007, the movie rights to Robert Graves' Claudius novels (a fictional autobiography of the Roman Emperor Claudius, who ruled from 41â€“54 A.D.), previously held by the BBC and Jim Sheridan, were expired and consequently brought back into the marketplace on behalf of the author's estate. The movie rights were contested by several studios, including Warner Bros., but producer Scott Rudin outbid them, buying the rights to Graves' Claudius novels ("I, Claudius" and "Claudius the God") in a two million dollar deal. The production companies of Monahan and DiCaprio (Henceforth and Appian Way, respectively) both had first look deals with Warner Bros., but despite the studio's losing bid, they became attached to the project with Monahan adapting the Claudius novels and DiCaprio starring.
Writing process.
Monahan has asserted that screenplays should be written by one author and does not support the collaborative model in which multiple screenwriters write competing drafts until the producer and director are satisfied. His interest in motion pictures began at an early age, but he admittedly steered clear of the film industry because he mistakenly surmised that the collaborative model was a de facto practice for creating screenplays. In his late 30s, he went to Hollywood to adapt his first novel into a film. Since then, he has generally been the sole writer on his screenplays, except for "Jurassic Park IV", which was taken over by John Sayles and rewritten when Monahan had to go on location for "Kingdom of Heaven". Monahan's view is that a screenwriter can retain the authorship of their screenplay if they have the support of a powerful film director and successfully advocate their ideas, even in the face of the inevitable influences of actors, directors and producers. He prefers writing screenplays over other genres because generally a released film will reach a wider audience and have a greater cultural effect than a published novel.
In his youth, Monahan developed an appreciation for Shakespeare and went on to concentrate on Shakespeare's works at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. He has studied English drama for over thirty years and has stated that because of those efforts he has reached a level of ability where he is "post-conscious about craft". He has a strong interest in history and reads the available primary sources when researching a historical period. While he aims for historical accuracy, he has remarked that even Shakespeare would take liberties if it dramatized a scene. He is critical of screenwriting courses that emphasize formulaic approaches to storytelling and that teach their students one kind of narrative in which characters must experience change while on a Hero's journey; he argues that these are types of stories and screenplay structure doesn't always have to follow such archetypes.
Monahan has quipped that he would prefer to work on an old Olivetti Praxis typewriter in many instances because there are too many distractions on a modern computer.
