Samantha Smith.
Samantha Reed Smith (June 29, 1972–August 25, 1985) was an American schoolgirl from Houlton, Maine who became famous in the Cold War-era United States and Soviet Union after writing a letter in 1982 to the Soviet Communist Party General Secretary Yuri Andropov, and receiving a reply from Andropov which included a personal invitation to visit the Soviet Union, which Smith accepted.
Smith attracted extensive mass media attention in both countries as a "Goodwill Ambassador" and later became known as "America's Youngest Ambassador" participating in peacemaking activities in Japan.
She wrote a book and co-starred in a television series before her death at the age of 13 in the Bar Harbor Airlines Flight 1808 plane crash.
Early years.
Smith was born in Houlton, Maine, and lived there with her parents, Arthur and Jane. She enjoyed field hockey, roller skating, reading, and science, and played on her school's softball team. At the age of five she wrote a letter to Queen Elizabeth II, telling her that she liked her. In 1980, when Smith had just finished second grade, her family moved to Manchester, where she attended Manchester Elementary School. Her father taught literature and writing at the University of Maine at Augusta, and her mother worked as a social worker with the Maine Department of Human Services. After Yuri Andropov became the Soviet leader, the leading American newspapers and magazines had his portrait on their covers and lead articles dedicated to him with rather negative views on his assumption of power and expectations of new threats to the world. During this period, massive anti-nuclear protests were taking place in Europe and North America, and there was expectation for the ABC nuclear war television film "The Day After" to be aired for November sweeps.
The two superpowers had now scrapped the concept of "détente", and Ronald Reagan had moved to deploy cruise missiles and the Pershing II missile in Europe in response to the Soviet deployment of SS-20s. The Soviet Union had been involved in a war in Afghanistan for three years at this time, which also contributed to the international tension. It was the November 22, 1982 issue of "Time" magazine article with Yuri Andropov on the cover that Smith saw.
"If people are so afraid of him," she asked her mother, "why doesn't someone write a letter asking whether he wants to have a war or not?" Her mother replied, "Why don't you?"
Letter exchange.
Her letter was published in the Soviet newspaper "Pravda".
Young Ambassador.
A media circus ensued, with Smith being interviewed by Ted Koppel and Johnny Carson, among others, and with nightly reports by the major American networks. On July 7, 1983, Smith flew to Moscow with her parents, spending two weeks as Andropov's guest. During this trip she visited Moscow and Leningrad, and spent some time in Artek, the main Soviet pioneer camp in the town of Gurzuf on the Crimean Peninsula. Smith wrote in her book that in Leningrad she and her parents were amazed by the friendliness of the people and by the presents many people made them. Speaking at a Moscow press conference, Smith declared that the Russians were "just like us."
In Artek she chose to stay with the Soviet children rather than take separate accommodation offered to her. For ease of communication, teachers and children with fluent English were chosen to live in the building where she was lodged. Staying in a dormitory with nine other girls, Smith spent her time swimming, talking, and learning Russian songs and dances. She made many friends there, including Natasha Kashirina from Leningrad, who spoke English fluently.
Andropov, however, was unable to meet with her during her visit,
although they did speak by telephone. It was later discovered that Andropov had become seriously ill and had withdrawn from the public eye during this time.
Smith also received a phone call from Russian cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman to orbit the Earth. However, not realizing with whom she was speaking, Samantha mistakenly hung up after only a brief conversation.
Media followed her every step — photographs and articles about her were published by the main Soviet newspapers and magazines throughout her trip and after it. Smith became widely known to Soviet citizens and was well regarded by many of them. In the United States, the event drew suspicion as "an American-style public relations stunt".
When Smith returned to the U.S. on July 22, 1983 her arrival was celebrated by the people of Maine with roses, a red carpet, and a limousine
and her popularity continued to grow in her native country. However, some critics at the time remained skeptical that Smith was unwittingly serving as an instrument of Soviet propaganda.
In December 1983, continuing in her role as "America's Youngest Ambassador", Smith was invited to Japan, where she met with the Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and attended the Children's International Symposium in Kobe. In her speech at the symposium, she suggested that Soviet and American leaders exchange granddaughters for two weeks every year, arguing that a president "wouldn't want to send a bomb to a country his granddaughter would be visiting". Her trip inspired other exchanges of child goodwill ambassadors, including a visit by the eleven year old Soviet child Katya Lycheva to the United States.
Later, Smith wrote a book called "Journey to the Soviet Union".
Television career.
Smith pursued her role as a media celebrity when in 1984 she hosted a children's special for the Disney Channel entitled "Samantha Smith Goes To Washington...Campaign '84". The show covered politics, where Smith interviewed several candidates for the 1984 presidential election, including George McGovern and Jesse Jackson. Her fame resulted in Smith becoming the subject of stalker Robert John Bardo, the man who would later go on to stalk and ultimately murder "My Sister Sam" actress Rebecca Schaeffer.
In 1985 she took on an acting role, co-starring with Robert Wagner in a television series called "Lime Street".
Death and funeral.
On August 25, 1985, Smith was returning home with her father after filming a segment for "Lime Street" aboard Bar Harbor Airlines Flight 1808. While attempting to land at Lewiston-Auburn Regional Airport in Auburn, Maine, the Beechcraft 99 communter plane struck some trees short of the runway and crashed, killing all six passengers and two crew on board.
Much speculation regarding the cause of the accident circulated afterwards. Accusations of foul play circulated in the Soviet Union.
An investigation was undertaken in the United States and the official report, which did not show evidence of foul play, was made public. As stated in the report, the accident occurred at about 22:05 EDT, the ground impact point located one mile (1.6 km) south-west of the airport, at. The report goes on to say, "The relatively steep flight path angle and the attitude (the orientation of the aircraft relative to the horizon, direction of motion etc.) and speed of the airplane at ground impact precluded the occupants from surviving the accident." The main point of the report was that it was a rainy night, the pilots were inexperienced, and an accidental, but not uncommon and not usually critical, ground radar failure occurred.
Samantha Smith was mourned by about 1,000 people at her funeral in Augusta, Maine, including Vladimir Kulagin of the Soviet Embassy in Washington, who read a personal message of condolence from Mikhail Gorbachev.
President Reagan sent his condolences to Samantha Smith's mother, writing,
"Perhaps you can take some measure of comfort in the knowledge that millions of Americans, indeed millions of people, share the burdens of your grief. They also will cherish and remember Samantha, her smile, her idealism and unaffected sweetness of spirit."
She and her father were buried near Houlton, where she was born.
Tributes.
Smith's contributions have been honored with a number of tributes by Russians and by the people of her home state of Maine.
A monument to her was built in Moscow; "Samantha Smith Alley" in the Artek Young Pioneer camp was named after her in 1986. The monument built to Smith was stolen by metal thieves in 2003 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. In 2003, Voronezh retiree Valentin Vaulin built a monument to her without any support from the government.
The Soviet Union issued a commemorative stamp with her likeness. In 1986, when Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Chernykh discovered asteroid 3147, she named it 3147 Samantha.
In 1985 the Danish composer Per Nørgård wrote the viola concerto "Remembering Child" in memory of Smith. A diamond found in Siberia,
a mountain in the former Soviet Union,
a cultivar of tulips and of dahlias, and an ocean vessel have been named in Smith's honor.
In Maine, the first Monday in June of each year is officially designated as Samantha Smith Day by state law. There is a bronze statue of Smith near the Maine State Museum in Augusta, which portrays Smith releasing a dove with a bear cub resting at her feet.
The bear cub represents both Maine and Russia. Elementary schools in Sammamish, Washington
and in Jamaica, New York
In October of 1985, Smith's mother founded the Samantha Smith Foundation,
which fostered student exchanges between the United States and the Soviet Union until it became dormant in 1995.
