Battle of Jutland.
The Battle of Jutland (German: "Skagerrakschlacht" ("Battle of the Skagerrak"); Danish: "Søslaget ved Jylland" / "Søslaget om Skagerrak") was the largest naval battle of World War I and the only full-scale clash of battleships in that war. It is also by certain criteria the largest naval battle in history. It was fought on 31 May – 1 June, 1916, in the North Sea near Jutland, the northward-pointing peninsular mainland of Denmark. The combatants were the Imperial German Navy's High Seas Fleet commanded by Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer and the Royal Navy’s British Grand Fleet commanded by Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. The intention of the German fleet was to lure out, trap and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, as the Germans were insufficient in number to engage the entire British fleet at one time. This formed part of their larger strategy of breaking the British naval blockade of the North Sea and allowing German mercantile shipping to operate again. The Royal Navy, on the other hand, was pursuing a strategy seeking to engage and destroy the High Seas Fleet or else keep the German force bottled up and away from British own shipping lanes.
The Germans' plan was to use Vice-Admiral Franz Hipper’s fast scouting group of five modern battlecruisers to lure Vice-Admiral Sir David Beatty’s battlecruiser squadrons through a submarine picket line and into the path of the main German fleet and so destroy them. But the British had learned from signal intercepts that a major fleet operation was likely, and on 30 May Jellicoe sailed with the Grand Fleet to rendezvous with Beatty, passing the intended positions of the German submarine pickets before the submarines had reached those positions.
On the afternoon of 31 May, Beatty encountered Hipper's battlecruiser force long before the Germans had expected, negating any submarine influence, but in a running battle Hipper successfully drew the British vanguard into the path of the High Seas Fleet. By the time Beatty turned towards the British main fleet he had lost two battlecruisers along with his numerical advantage over Hipper. However the German fleet in pursuit of Beatty was drawn towards the main British fleet. From 18:30 hrs, when the sun was lowering on the western horizon ing the British forces, until nightfall at about 20:30 the two huge fleets — totaling 250 ships between them — were heavily engaged.
Fourteen British and eleven German ships were sunk with great loss of life. After sunset, and throughout the night, Jellicoe manœuvered to cut the Germans off from their base in hopes of continuing the battle in the morning, but under cover of darkness Scheer crossed the wake of the British fleet and returned to port.
Both sides claimed victory. The British had lost more ships and many more sailors, and the British press criticized the Grand Fleet's actions, but Scheer’s plan of destroying Beatty’s squadrons had also failed. The Germans continued to pose a threat that required the British to keep their battleships concentrated in the North Sea, but they never again contested control of the high seas. Instead, the German Navy turned its efforts and resources to unrestricted submarine warfare.
German planning.
The plan for May 1916 was to station a large number of U-boats off the British naval bases and lure Beatty's battlecruiser squadrons out by sending a fast battlecruiser force under Hipper to raid the British coast at Sunderland. If all went well, "after the British sortied in response to the raiding attack force", the British squadrons would be weakened by the picketing submarine ambush, and the British Navy's centuries-long tradition of aggressive action could be used to draw the pursuing but weakened units after Hipper's cruisers, towards the German main force under Scheer. It was hoped that Scheer would be able to effectively ambush a section of the British fleet and destroy it.
It was further hoped that, once a submarine had attacked successfully, fast escorts such as destroyers would be tied down conducting anti-submarine operations. The German plan thus had several strings to its bow, and had the Germans caught the British in the positions where they expected them to be, they would have stood a chance of inflicting losses which would have helped to redress the material balance between the fleets.
Unfortunately for the German plan, the British had been given a copy of the main German code book from the light cruiser SMS "Magdeburg", boarded by Russian naval officers after the ship ran aground in Russian territorial waters. Therefore intercepted German naval radio communications could usually be quickly deciphered; hence the British Admiralty was usually aware of German deployments and levels of activity, giving it an insight into, and forewarning of, German plans.
British response.
The British intercepted and decrypted a German signal on 28 May ordering all ships to be ready for sea on the 30th. Further signals were intercepted and although they were not decrypted it was clear that a major operation was likely.
Not knowing the Germans' objective, Jellicoe and his staff decided to position the fleet to head off any attempt by the Germans to enter the North Atlantic, or the Baltic through the Skagerrak, by taking up a position off Norway where they could possibly cut off any German raid into the shipping lanes of the Atlantic, or prevent the Germans from heading into the Baltic. A position further west was unnecessary as that area of the North Sea could be patrolled by air using blimps and scouting aircraft.
Consequently, Admiral Jellicoe led the Grand Fleet of twenty-four battleships and three battlecruisers eastwards out of Scapa Flow before Hipper's raiding force left the Jade Estuary on 30 May and the German High Seas Fleet could follow. Beatty's faster force of six battlecruisers and four battleships left the Firth of Forth on the next day, and Jellicoe's intention was to rendezvous west of the mouth of Skagerrak off the coast of Jutland and wait for the Germans or for their intentions to become clear. The planned position gave him the widest range of responses to likely German intentions.
Orders of battle.
Jellicoe's battle force had a strength of thirty-seven dreadnoughts (twenty-eight battleships and nine battlecruisers), while Scheer had sixteen dreadnought battleships, five battlecruisers and six obsolete pre-dreadnought battleships. The British also had greatly superior numbers in lighter vessels. Because the German navy had a preference for protection over firepower in its ship design German ships had thicker and/or more extensive armour, but carried fewer guns, or guns of smaller calibre, than their British counterparts. No German ship participating in the battle was equipped with guns larger than 12-inch (305 mm) while most British capital ships had 13.5-inch (343 mm) or 15-inch (381 mm) guns. Combined with their larger number this gave the British fleet a total weight of broadside of 332,400 lb (151 tonnes), compared with 134,000 lb (61 tonnes) for the High Seas Fleet.
The German ships had better internal subdivision as they were only designed for short cruises in the North Sea and their crews lived in barracks ashore when in harbour; therefore they did not need to be as habitable as the British vessels, and had fewer doors and other weak points in their bulkheads. German armour-piercing shells were far more effective than the British shells; and, which turned out to be a factor of vital importance, the British cordite propellant (lyddite) tended to explode when British ships were hit by incoming shellfire rather than 'burn' as did the German propellant. Moreover the British magazines were not adequately protected, since the Royal Navy emphasized speed on ammunition handling over safety procedures, hence enhancing the rate of fire, but leaving the ships vulnerable to flash damage. On the other hand the British fire control systems, based on Dreyer tables and mechanical computers, were well in advance of the German ones, as demonstrated by the proportion of main calibre hits under manœuvre. The Royal Navy used centralized fire control systems on their capital ships, while Germans controlled the fire on turrets individually.
Naval tactics in 1916.
The principle of concentration of force was fundamental to the fleet tactics of this period (as indeed of earler periods). Tactical doctrine called for a fleet approaching battle to be in a compact formation of parallel columns, allowing relatively easy manœuvring, and giving shortened sight lines within the formation which facilitated passing of the signals necessary for command and control.
It was a fundamental advantage of such a formation that a fleet formed in several short columns could change its heading faster than could one formed in a single long column. Since command signals in this era were limited to visible means — made with flags or shuttered searchlights between ships — the flagship was usually placed at the head of the centre column so that its signals might be more easily seen by the many ships of the formation.
Poor visibility sometimes meant that a ship might only be able to recognize the signals of its nearest neighbour or neighbours in the fleet. In these circumstances it was necessary for signals to be repeated by each vessel for an admiral's orders to be communicated to the whole formation. This problem was aggravated by the fact that the coal-fired ships of the era generated a great deal of funnel smoke, which was often the main factor interfering with visibility.
Thus it might take a long time for a signal from the flagship to be relayed to the entire formation. It was usually necessary for a signal to be confirmed by each ship before it could be relayed to other ships, and an order for a fleet movement would have to be received and acknowledged by every ship before it could be executed. In a large single-column formation a signal could take ten minutes or more to be passed from one end of the line to the other, whereas in a formation of parallel columns, visibility across the diagonals was often better (and always shorter) than in a single long column, and the diagonals gave signal "redundancy", increasing the probability that a message would been quickly seen and correctly interpreted.
However, before battle was joined the heavy units of the fleet would, if possible, deploy into a single column. In order to form the battle-line in the correct orientation relative to the enemy the commanding admiral needed to know the enemy fleet's distance, bearing, heading and speed. It was the task of the scouting forces, consisting primarily of battlecruisers and cruisers, to find the enemy and to report this information in sufficient time, and, if possible, to deny the enemy's scouting forces the opportunity of obtaining the equivalent information.
Ideally the battle-line would cross the intended path of the enemy column so that the maximum number of guns could be brought to bear, while the enemy could only fire with the forward guns of the leading ships. The Japanese admiral Togo had achieved this against the Russian Fleet in 1905 at the Battle of Tsushima. Jellicoe was to achieve this twice in one hour against the High Seas Fleet at Jutland, but on both occasions Scheer was able to turn away and disengage, thereby avoiding the destruction of his fleet.
Prelude to big guns.
The German U-boats were completely ineffective; they did not sink a single ship and provided no useful information as scouts. Jellicoe's ships proceeded to his rendezvous undamaged but misled by Admiralty intelligence that the Germans were nine hours later than they actually were.
At 14:20 on 31 May, despite heavy haze and scuds of fog giving poor visibility, scouts from Beatty's force reported enemy ships to the south-east; the British light units, investigating a neutral Danish steamer (N. J. Fjord) which was sailing between the two fleets, had also found German scouts engaged in the same mission. Beatty moved eastwards to cut the German ships off from their base. The first shots of the battle were fired when "Galatea" of the British 1st Light Cruiser Squadron mistook two German destroyers for cruisers and engaged them. "Galatea" was subsequently hit at extreme range by her German counterpart, "Elbing", of Rear-Admiral Bodicker's Scouting Group II.
At 15:30, Beatty's forces sighted Hipper's cruisers moving south-east. Hipper promptly turned away to lead Beatty towards Scheer. Beatty, some three miles (5 km) from Rear-Admiral Sir Hugh Evan-Thomas's column (5th Battle Squadron), turned towards the enemy and signalled by flag for the 5th Battle Squadron to follow.
The Run to the South.
Given the distance and visibility, the 5th Battle Squadron could not read the flag signals; and as Beatty made no effort to communicate via searchlight or radio telegraph, Evan-Thomas continued on his original course for several minutes. Beatty's conduct during the next quarter of an hour has received a great deal of criticism, as his ships out-ranged and outnumbered the German squadron, yet he held his fire. At 15:45, after having the German ships within range for over ten minutes, and with the opposing forces roughly parallel at 15,000 nautical-yards (), Hipper opened fire, followed by Beatty. Thus began the opening phase of the battlecruiser action, known as the "Run to the South". During the first minutes of the ensuing battle, all the British ships fired well over their German opponents, before finally getting the range.
Beatty had ordered his ships to engage in a line, one British ship engaging with one German and his flagship "Lion" doubling on the German flagship "Lützow". However, due to another mistake on the part of the British, "Derfflinger" was left unengaged and free to fire without disruption, while "Moltke" drew fire from two of Beatty's battlecruisers. The Germans drew first blood. Hipper's five battlecruisers quickly registered hits on three of the six British battlecruisers. Nearly ten minutes passed before the British managed to score their first hit. It has been estimated that during the next phase the German battlecruisers made thirty-five hits, compared with eleven achieved by the British.
Sudden death.
The first near-disaster of the battle occurred when a 12-inch (305 mm) salvo from "Lützow" wrecked "Q" turret of Beatty's flagship "Lion". Dozens of crewmen were instantly killed, but a far larger catastrophe was averted when the mortally wounded turret commander, Major Francis Harvey of the Royal Marines, promptly ordered the magazine doors shut and the magazine flooded, thereby preventing the fickle propellant from setting off a massive magazine explosion. "Lion" was saved. "Indefatigable" was not so lucky; at 16:00, just fifteen minutes into the slugging match, she was smashed aft by three 11-inch (280 mm) shells from "Von der Tann", causing damage sufficient to knock her out of line and drop her speed significantly. Soon after, despite the near-maximum range, "Von der Tann" put another 11-inch (280 mm) salvo on one of her 12-inch (305 mm) turrets. The plunging shells easily pierced the thin upper armour and "Indefatigable" was ripped apart by a magazine explosion, sinking immediately with her crew of 1,019 officers and men, leaving only two survivors.
That tipped the odds to Hipper's benefit, for a brief while as Admiral Evan-Thomas, essentially chasing from oblique (astern) finally manœuvered his squadron of four fast "super-dreadnoughts" into long range. He commanded a squadron of the "Queen Elizabeth" class armed with 15-inch (381 mm) guns. With occasional 15-inch (381 mm) shells landing on his ships at long ranges, Hipper was in a tight spot and unable to respond at all against Evan-Thomas's squadron with his smaller shorter-ranged guns, but had his hands full with Beatty's units. He also knew his baiting mission was close to completion and his force was rapidly closing with Scheer's main body and had little choice as there was little speed difference between the sides engaged. At 16:25 the battlecruiser action intensified again when "Queen Mary" was hit by what may have been a combined salvo from "Derfflinger" and "Seydlitz", and she disintegrated in a magazine explosion with all but nine of her 1,275 man crew lost.
Two points to port.
Shortly after, a salvo struck on or around "Princess Royal", which was obscured by spray and smoke. A signalman promptly leapt onto the bridge of "Lion" and announced "Princess Royal's" blown up, Sir." Beatty famously turned to his flag captain, saying "Chatfield, there seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today. Turn two-points to port", i.e. two points nearer the enemy. However, the signalman's report was incorrect, as "Princess Royal" survived the battle.
At about 16:30, "Southampton" of Beatty's 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron led by Commodore William Goodenough sighted the main body of Scheer's High Seas Fleet, dodging numerous heavy-calibre salvos to report in detail the German strength: sixteen dreadnoughts with six older battleships. Simultaneously a destroyer action raged in the space between the opposing battlecruiser forces, as British destroyers fought with their German counterparts and managed to put a torpedo into "Seydlitz". The destroyer "Nestor", under the command of Captain Bingham, sank two German torpedo boats, "V 27" and "V 29", before she and another destroyer, "Nomad", were immobilized by hits. "Nestor" and "Nomad" were later sunk by Scheer's dreadnoughts.
The Run to the North.
Beatty headed north to draw the Germans towards Jellicoe and managed to break contact with the Germans at about 16:45. Beatty's movement towards Jellicoe is called the "Run to the North". Because Beatty once again failed to signal his intentions adequately, the super-dreadnoughts of the 5th Battle Squadron found themselves lagging behind the battlecruisers and heading directly into the main body of the High Seas Fleet.
Their difficulty was compounded by Beatty, who gave the order to Evan-Thomas to "turn in succession" rather than "turn together". There is poorly-referenced speculation that the exact wording of the order originated with Lieutenant-Commander Ralph Seymour, Beatty's flag lieutenant, rather than Beatty himself. This should have resulted in all four ships turning, in succession to transit through the same patch of sea, which gave the High Seas Fleet repeated opportunity with ample time to find the proper range. Consequently, the trailing ships experienced a period wherein they had to fend off the lead German dreadnoughts and Hipper's battlecruisers on their own. Fortunately, the dreadnoughts were far better suited to take this sort of pounding than the battlecruisers, and none were lost, as in the event, one captain turned early mitigating the adverse results. Nonetheless, "Malaya" sustained heavy casualties in the process, likely lessened by the initiative of her Captain in turning early. At the same time, the 15-inch (381 mm) fire of the four British ships remained effective, causing severe damage to the German battlecruisers.
Still fighting blind.
Jellicoe was now aware that full fleet engagement was nearing, but had insufficient information on the position and course of the Germans. Rear-Admiral Horace Hood's 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron was ordered to speed ahead to assist Beatty, while Rear-Admiral Arbuthnot's 1st Cruiser Squadron patrolled the van of the main body for eventual deployment of Jellicoe's dreadnought columns.
Around 17:30 the armoured cruiser "Black Prince" of Arbuthnot's squadron, bearing southeast, came within view of Beatty's leading 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron, establishing the first visual link between the converging bodies of the Grand Fleet. Simultaneously the signals cruiser "Chester", steaming behind Hood's battlecruisers, was intercepted by the van of the German scouting forces under Rear-Admiral Bodicker.
Heavily outnumbered by Bodicker's four light cruisers, "Chester" was pounded before being relieved by Hood's heavy units which swung back westward for that purpose. Hood's flagship "Invincible" disabled the light cruiser "Wiesbaden" as Bodicker's other ships fled toward Hipper and Scheer, in the mistaken belief that Hood was leading a larger force of British capital ships from the north and east. Another destroyer action ensued as German torpedo boats attempted to blunt the arrival of this new formation.
The fleet action.
In the meantime Beatty and Evan-Thomas had resumed their engagement with Hipper's battlecruisers, this time with the visual conditions to their advantage. With several of his ships damaged, Hipper turned back towards Scheer at around 18.00, just as Beatty's flagship "Lion" was finally sighted from Jellicoe's flagship "Iron Duke". Jellicoe promptly demanded the latest position of the German forces from Beatty, who failed to respond to the question for almost ten minutes.
Jellicoe, having overestimated the enemy forces, was in a worrying position, needing to know the location of the German fleet in order to judge when and how to deploy his battleships from their cruising formation (in six columns of four ships each) into a single battle-line. The deployment could be on either the westernmost or the easternmost column, and had to be carried out before the Germans arrived; but early deployment could mean losing any chance of a decisive encounter. Deploying to the west would bring his fleet closer to Scheer, gaining valuable time as dusk approached, but the Germans might arrive before the manœuvre was complete. Deploying to the east would take the force away from Scheer, but Jellicoe's ships might be able to cross the "T" and would have the advantage of silhouetting Scheer's forces against the setting sun to the west. Deployment would take twenty irreplaceable minutes, and the fleets were closing at speed. Jellicoe ordered deployment to the east at 18:10 ❷.
Meanwhile Hipper had rejoined Scheer, and the combined High Seas Fleet was heading north, directly toward Jellicoe. Scheer had no indication that Jellicoe was at sea, let alone that he was bearing down from the northwest, and was distracted by the intervention of Hood's ships to his north and east. Beatty's four surviving battlecruisers were now crossing the van of the British dreadnoughts to join Hood's three battlecruisers; in doing so, Beatty nearly rammed Rear-Admiral Arbuthnot's flagship "Defence".
Arbuthnot's obsolete armoured cruisers had no real place in the coming clash between modern dreadnoughts, but he was attracted by the drifting hull of the crippled "Wiesbaden". With "Warrior", "Defence" closed in for the kill, only to blunder right into the gunsights of Hipper's and Scheer's oncoming capital ships. "Defence" was destroyed in a spectacular explosion viewed by most of the deploying Grand Fleet, sinking with all hands (903 officers and men). "Warrior" was hit badly but spared destruction by the mishap to the nearby superdreadnought "Warspite". "Warspite" had been steaming near 25 knots (46 km/h) to keep pace with the 5th Battle Squadron as it tailed Beatty's battlecruisers in the run north, creating enough strain to jam her rudder. Drifting in a wide circle, she appeared as a juicy target to the German dreadnoughts and took thirteen hits, inadvertently drawing fire from the hapless "Warrior". This unintentional maneouvre by "Warspite" was known as "Windy Corner". Despite surviving the onslaught, "Warspite" was soon ordered back to port by Evan-Thomas.
As "Defence" sank, Hipper moved within range of Hood's 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron. "Invincible" inflicted two below-waterline hits on "Lützow" that would ultimately doom Hipper's flagship, but at about 18:30 abruptly appeared as a clear target before "Lützow" and "Derfflinger". A series of 12-inch (305 mm) shells struck "Invincible", which blew up and split in two, killing all but six of her crew of 1,032 officers and men, including Rear-Admiral Hood.
By 18:30 the main fleet action was joined for the first time, with Jellicoe effectively "crossing Scheer's T" ❸. Jellicoe's flagship "Iron Duke" quickly scored a series of hits on the lead German dreadnought, "König", but in this brief exchange, which lasted only minutes, as few as ten of the Grand Fleet's twenty-four dreadnoughts actually opened fire. The Germans were hampered by poor visibility in addition to being in an unfavourable tactical position. Realizing he was heading into a trap, Scheer ordered his fleet to turn and flee at 18:33. Under a pall of smoke and mist Scheer's forces succeeded in disengaging.
Conscious of the risks to his capital ships posed by torpedoes, Jellicoe did not chase directly but headed south, determined to keep the High Seas Fleet west of him. Scheer knew that it was not yet dark enough to escape and his fleet would suffer terribly in a stern chase, so at 18:55 he doubled back to the east ❹. In his memoirs he wrote, "the manœuvre would be bound to surprise the enemy, to upset his plans for the rest of the day, and if the blow fell heavily it would facilitate the breaking loose at night." But the turn to the east took his ships towards Jellicoe's.
Commodore Goodenough's 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron dodged the fire of German battleships for a second time to re-establish contact with the High Seas Fleet shortly after 19:00. By 19:15, Jellicoe had crossed the "T" yet again ❺. This time his arc of fire was tighter and deadlier, causing severe damage to the Germans, particularly Rear-Admiral Behncke's leading 3rd Battle Squadron. At 19:17, for the second time in less than an hour, Scheer turned to the west, ordering a major torpedo attack by his destroyers and a "death ride" by Scouting Group I's four remaining battlecruisers — "Lützow" being out of action and abandoned by Hipper — to deter a British chase. In this portion of the engagement the Germans sustained thirty-seven heavy hits while inflicting only two, "Derfflinger" alone receiving fourteen. Nonetheless Scheer slipped away as sunset (at 20:24) approached. The last major exchange between capital ships in this battle took place as the surviving British battlecruisers caught up with their German counterparts, which were briefly relieved by Rear-Admiral Mauve's obsolete pre-dreadnoughts ❻. As "King George V" and "Westfalen" exchanged a few final shots, neither side could have imagined that the only encounter between British and German dreadnoughts in the entire war was already concluded.
At 21:00, Jellicoe, conscious of the Grand Fleet's deficiencies in night-fighting, decided to try to avoid a major engagement until early dawn. He placed a screen of cruisers and destroyers behind his battle fleet to patrol the rear as he headed south to guard against Scheer's expected escape. In reality Scheer opted to cross Jellicoe's wake and escape via Horns Reef. Luckily for Scheer, Jellicoe's scouts failed to report his true course, while Jellicoe himself was too cautious to conclude from the extensive circumstantial evidence that the Germans were breaking through astern of his battleships.
While the nature of Scheer's escape, and Jellicoe's inaction, indicate the overall German superiority in night-fighting, the results of the night action were no more clear-cut than were those of the battle as a whole. "Southampton", Commodore Goodenough's flagship which had scouted so proficiently, was heavily damaged but managed to sink the German light cruiser "Frauenlob" which went down at 22:23 with all hands (320 officers and men). But at 02:00 on 1 June, "Black Prince" of the ill-fated 1st Cruiser Squadron met a grim fate at the hands of the battleship "Thüringen", blowing up with all hands (857 officers and men) as her squadron leader "Defence" had done hours earlier. At 02:10, several British destroyer flotillas launched a torpedo attack on the German battlefleet. At the cost of five destroyers sunk and some others damaged, they managed to sink the predreadnought "Pommern" with all hands (844 officers and men), as well as to torpedo the light cruiser "Rostock" and causing another, "Elbing", to be rammed by the dreadnought "Posen" and abandoned. The battlecruiser "Lützow" was torpedoed at 01:45 on orders of her captain (von Harder) by the destroyer G38 after the surviving crew of 1,150 transferred to destroyers that came alongside.
The Germans were helped in their escape by the failure of British naval intelligence in London to relay a critical radio intercept giving the true position of the High Seas Fleet. By the time Jellicoe finally learned of Scheer's whereabouts at 04:15 it was clear the battle could no longer be resumed. There would be no "Glorious First of June" in 1916.
The outcome.
At Jutland, the Germans, with a 99-strong fleet, sank 115,000 tons of British ships, while a 151-strong British fleet sank 62,000 tons of German ships. The British lost 6,094 seamen, the Germans 2,551. Several other ships were badly damaged, such as HMS "Lion" and SMS "Seydlitz". At the end of the battle the British had maintained their numerical superiority, and had twenty three dreadnoughts ready and four battle-cruisers still able to fight, while the Germans had ten. Even more to the point, as damaged Dreadnoughts Warspite and Malaya went in for repairs, Queen Elizabeth and Emperor of India joined the fleet with Resolution and Ramillies soon to join. Princess Royal and Tiger in dockyard would be replaced by Australia, far from being weakened the Grand Fleet was stronger than it was within a month of sailing to Jutland.
While the British had not destroyed the German fleet, and had lost more ships than their enemy, the Germans had retreated to harbour and at the end of the battle the British were in command of the area, notwithstanding their losses. Moreover, the damaged British ships were restored to operational status more quickly than were the German, which offset in some respects the superior performance of the German forces.
At a strategic level the outcome has been the subject of a huge literature, with no clear consensus. In the immediate aftermath, the view of the battle as indecisive was widely held, and remains influential The Germans had failed in their objective of destroying a substantial portion of the British Fleet. On the other hand, the High Seas Fleet survived as a fleet in being. Most of its losses were made good within a month — even "Seydlitz", the most badly damaged ship to survive the battle, was fully repaired by October and officially back in service by November.
More recently, however, there had been considerable support for the view of Jutland as a decisive strategic victory for the British. The German fleet would only sortie twice more, on 18 August and in October 1916. Apart from these two (abortive) operations the High Seas Fleet – unwilling to risk another encounter with the British fleet – remained inactive for the duration of the war. Jutland thus ended the German challenge to British naval supremacy.
A third view is that Jutland illustrated the irrelevance of battleship fleets following the development of the submarine, mine and torpedo. On this view, the most important consequence of Jutland was the subsequent decision of the Germans to engage in unrestricted submarine warfare.
Battlecruisers.
The British Battlecruisers were designed to chase down and destroy enemy cruisers from a range cruisers could not effectively reply from. They were not designed to be "Ships of the Line" and exchange broadsides with the enemy. It should be noted that despite the destruction of one German and three British battlecruisers, none of them was destroyed by enemy shells penetrating the belt armor and detonating the magazines. Each of the British Battlecruisers was penetrated through her turret roof and her magazines ignited by flash passing through turret, and shell handling rooms. The "Lutzow" sustained 24 hits, and her flooding could not be contained. She was eventually sunk by her escorts' torpedoes after her crew had been safely removed. "Derfflinger" and "Seydlitz" sustained 22 hits each but made it to port (though "Seydlitz" just barely).
Procedural lapses.
During the summer of 2003, a diving expedition examined the wrecks of "Invincible", "Queen Mary", "Defence", and "Lützow" to investigate the cause of the British ships' tendency to suffer from internal explosions. On this evidence, a major part of the blame may be laid on lax handling of the cordite propellant for the shells of the main guns. This, in turn, was a product of contemporary British naval doctrine, which emphasised a rapid rate of fire in the direction of the enemy rather than slower, more accurate fire.
In practice drills, emphasizing speed of firing, the cordite could not be supplied to the guns rapidly enough through the hoists and hatches; in order to bring up the propellant for the next broadside before the time when it had to be loaded, many safety doors which should have been kept shut to safeguard against flash fires were opened, bags of cordite were locally stocked and kept locally to need creating a total break down of safety design features and this 'bad safety habit' carried over into real battle practices.
Furthermore, whereas the German propellant "RP C/12" was supplied in brass cylinders, British cordite was supplied in silk bags, making it more susceptible to flash fires. The doctrine of a high rate of fire also led to the decision in 1913 to increase the supply of shells and cordite held on the British ships by 50 per cent, for fear of running out of ammunition; when this caused the capacity of the ships' magazines to be exceeded, cordite was stored in insecure places.
There was a further difference in the propellent itself, "RP C/12" burned when exposed to fire it did not explode while cordite would. Extensively studied by the British "RP C/12" after WWI would form the basis of Cordite SC later.
After the battle the Admiralty produced a report critical of the cordite handling practices. By this time Jellicoe had been promoted to First Sea Lord, and Beatty to command of the Grand Fleet; the report, which indirectly placed part of the blame for the disaster on the fleet's officers, was not widely distributed, and effectively suppressed from public scrutiny.
During the early stages of the war the German battlecruisers suffered from equally poor cordite handling practices. It was not until the Battle of Dogger Bank, where "Seydlitz" was nearly lost to a similar, catastrophic magazine explosion, that the Germans became aware of the dangers of poor cordite handling procedures. The ship was only saved through the heroic actions of Wilhelm Heidkamp, who opened white-hot valves which flooded the turret. It was only after this incident that the Germans rectified this serious problem.
Flawed Paradigm.
Other analysis of the battle showed that the British concept and use of the battlecruiser was wholly flawed. The battlecruiser had been designed according to Jackie Fisher's dictum that "speed is armour". They were intended to be faster than battleships, with superior fire control, and able to pound lighter enemy cruisers at ranges at which the enemy could not reply. In the event, the whole concept was negated when British battlecruisers were asked to fight German ships which were just as fast, exercised better gunnery, and were better armoured instead of holding the enemy beyond his maximum range.
Controversy.
At the time Jellicoe was criticised for his caution and for allowing Scheer to escape. Beatty in particular was convinced that Jellicoe had missed a tremendous opportunity to win another Trafalgar and annihilate the High Seas Fleet. Jellicoe was promoted away from active command to become the professional head of the Royal Navy, First Sea Lord, while Beatty replaced him as commander of the British Grand Fleet.
The controversy raged within the Navy and in public for about a decade after the war. Criticism focused on Jellicoe's decision at 19:15. Scheer had ordered his cruisers and destroyers forward in a torpedo attack to cover the turning away of his battleships. Jellicoe chose to turn away to the southeast and so keep out of range of the torpedoes. If Jellicoe had instead turned to the west, could his ships have dodged the torpedoes and destroyed the German fleet? Supporters of Jellicoe, including the naval historian Julian Corbett, pointed out the folly of risking defeat in battle when you already have command of the sea. Jellicoe himself, in a letter to the Admiralty before the battle, had stated that in the event of a fleet engagement in which the enemy turned away he would assume that the intention was to draw him over mines or submarines and he would decline to be so drawn. This appreciation was at the time accepted by the Admiralty. (Corbett's volume of the official history of the war, "Naval Operations", contains the extraordinary disclaimer, "Their Lordships find that some of the principles advocated in the book, especially the tendency to minimise the importance of seeking battle and forcing it to a conclusion, are directly in conflict with their views.")
The stakes were very high, the pressure on Jellicoe was immense, and his caution is certainly understandable — his judgment might have been that even 90% odds in favour were not good enough on which to bet the British Empire. The former First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill said of the battle that Jellicoe "was the only man on either side who could have lost the war in an afternoon."
The criticism of Jellicoe also fails to give enough credit to Scheer, who was determined to preserve his fleet by avoiding a decisive engagement, and showed great skill in effecting his escape.
Beatty's actions.
Another school of thought condemns the actions of Admiral Beatty for the British failure to achieve a complete victory. Although Beatty was undeniably a brave man, his encounter with the High Seas Fleet almost cost the British the battle. Most of the British losses in tonnage occurred in Beatty's force.
Beatty's lack of control over the battlecruiser action is often criticised. Moreover, some claim his main failure was in not providing Jellicoe with precise information on the whereabouts of the High Seas Fleet and in not ensuring that communications "redundancy" was used. Beatty did not apparently appreciate the finer points of command and control over a naval engagement, or the potential weaknesses of his own ships. Beatty, aboard the battlecruiser "Lion", repeatedly overlooked the four fast battleships of the 5th Battle Squadron under his command, engaging with six ships when better control could have given him ten against Hipper’s five. Despite Beatty's and guns having greater range than Hipper's guns, Beatty closed the gap between the opposing squadrons until the Germans' superior gunnery took its toll.
Even his famous remark "There's something wrong with our bloody ships today" could be construed as Beatty seeking to deflect blame away from himself. Despite his poor control of his battlecruisers, his neglect of the 5th Battle Squadron and inadequate battle preparedness, Beatty was fully prepared to lambast Admiral Jellicoe for not being aggressive enough; even though during the course of the battle Beatty, and Admiral Arbuthnot, had shown the folly of charging in for the attack. Jellicoe clearly understood the capabilities of his ships and the risks he faced; it is not clear that Beatty did.

Status of the survivors and wrecks.
On the 90th anniversary of the battle, in 2006, the Ministry of Defence announced that the 14 British vessels lost in the battle were being designated as "protected places" under the Protection of Military Remains Act. The last living veteran of the battle is Henry Allingham, a British RAF (originally RNAS) airman, aged 111. One ship survives and is still in commission: HMS Caroline.
