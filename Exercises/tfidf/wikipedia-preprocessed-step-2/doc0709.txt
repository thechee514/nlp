List of male tennis players.
This is a list of top international male tennis players.
To keep the list at a reasonable length, it includes only players who have been officially ranked among the top 25 singles players in the "Open Era"; been ranked in the top few prior to the Open Era; have been a singles quarter-finalist or better at a Grand Slam tournament; have been finalists at the Tennis Masters Cup; have been singles medalists at the Olympic Games; have won a Grand Slam or Olympic doubles title; or have been ranked World No. 1 in singles or doubles.
Players who have won more than one Grand Slam singles title or have been ranked World No.1 in singles have been put in bold font so as to stand out. Information on each player includes year of birth and death, country of origin or citizenship, and accolades which refer to singles play unless otherwise stated.
