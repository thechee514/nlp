Bolesław Prus.
Bolesław Prus (pronounced: a>; August 20, 1847 – May 19, 1912), whose actual name was Aleksander Głowacki, was a Polish journalist, short-story writer and novelist. The leading representative of realism in 19th-century Polish literature, Głowacki took the pen name "Prus" from the name of his family coat-of-arms.
An indelible mark was left on Prus by his experiences as a 15-year-old soldier in the Polish January 1863 Uprising against Imperial Russia, in which he suffered severe injuries and imprisonment.
In 1872, at age 25, Prus settled into a distinguished 40-year journalistic career. In the spirit of the Positivist, anti-Romantic philosophy prevalent in post-1863-Uprising Poland, he helped prepare his compatriots to compete in a world increasingly dominated by science and technology.
As a sideline, to broaden the appeal of his ideas, Prus began writing short stories. Achieving success with these, he went on to employ a broader canvas. Between 1886 and 1895, he completed four novels on "great questions of the day." Perennial favorites with his countrymen are "The Doll" and "Pharaoh".
Early years.
Aleksander Głowacki was born on August 20, 1847, in Hrubieszów, Poland, the younger son of Antoni Głowacki, an estate steward in the village of Żabcze, in Hrubieszów County, and Apolonia Głowacka, "née" Trembińska. In 1850, when the future "Bolesław Prus" was three years old, his mother died; the child was given into the care of his maternal grandmother, Marcjanna Trembińska of Puławy, and, four years later, of his aunt, Domicela Olszewska of Lublin. In 1856 Prus was orphaned by his father's death. In 1862 his brother Leon, a teacher who was thirteen years older than Prus, took him to Siedlce, then to Kielce.
Soon after the Polish January 1863 Uprising against Imperial Russia began, 15-year-old Prus ran away from school to join the insurgents, perhaps influenced by Leon, who subsequently became one of the insurrection's leaders. During the Uprising, Leon developed a mental illness that he would suffer from until his death in 1907. On September 1, 1863, twelve days after his sixteenth birthday, Prus himself took part in a battle against Russian forces at the village of Białka, four kilometers south of Siedlce; he suffered contusions to the neck and gunpowder injuries to his eyes, and was captured unconscious on the battlefield and taken to hospital in Siedlce. This experience may have caused his subsequent lifelong agoraphobia.
Eventually released on account of his youth, in 1866 he completed secondary school and enrolled in the Department of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Warsaw.
His studies were cut short in 1868 due to financial difficulties. In 1869 he enrolled at the Agricultural and Forestry Institute in Puławy, a town in which he had spent part of his childhood; he was, however, soon expelled after a classroom confrontation with a Russian professor. Henceforth he studied on his own while supporting himself as a tutor, a factory worker, and, from 1872, as a journalist. Journalism would become his school of writing.
In 1873 Prus delivered two public lectures whose subjects illustrate the breadth of his scientific interests: "On the Structure of the Universe," and "On Discoveries and Inventions."
Journalism.
As a newspaper columnist, Prus commented on the achievements of scientists and scholars such as John Stuart Mill, Charles Darwin, Alexander Bain, Herbert Spencer and Henry Thomas Buckle; urged Poles to study science and technology and to develop industry and commerce; encouraged the establishment of charitable institutions to benefit the underprivileged; described the fiction and nonfiction works of fellow writers such as H.G. Wells; and extolled man-made and natural wonders such as the Wieliczka Salt Mine, the town of Nałęczów, and an 1887 solar eclipse that he witnessed at Mława.
His "Weekly Chronicles" spanned forty years (they have since been reprinted in twenty volumes), and would help prepare the ground for the 20th-century blossoming of Polish science and especially Polish mathematics. "Our national life," wrote Prus, "will take a normal course only when we have become a useful, indispensable element of civilization, when we have become able to give nothing for free and to demand nothing for free." The social importance of science and technology would recur as a theme in his novels "The Doll" (1889) and "Pharaoh" (1895).
Of contemporary thinkers, the one who most greatly influenced Prus and other writers of the Polish "Positivist" period (roughly 1864–1900) was Herbert Spencer, the English sociologist who coined the phrase, "survival of the fittest." Prus would call Spencer "the Aristotle of the 19th century" and would write: "I grew up under the influence of Spencerian evolutionary philosophy and heeded its counsels, not those of Idealist or Comtean philosophy." Prus interpreted "survival of the fittest," in the societal sphere, as involving not only competition but also cooperation; and he adopted Spencer's metaphor of society as organism. He would use this metaphor to striking effect in his 1884 micro-story "Mold of the Earth," and in the introduction to his 1895 historical novel, "Pharaoh".
After Prus began writing regular weekly newspaper columns, his finances stabilized, permitting him on January 14, 1875, to marry a distant cousin on his mother's side, Oktawia Trembińska. The couple never had children of their own. They did adopt a son, Emil Trembiński (born September 11, 1886, the son of Prus's wife's brother Michał Trembiński, who had died on November 10, 1888). Emil would be the model for "Rascal" in chapter 48 of Prus's 1895 novel, "Pharaoh". Tragically, on February 18, 1904, at age seventeen, Emil would shoot himself dead on the doorstep of an unrequited love. In 1906, at the age of fifty-nine, Prus may have had a son who would become one of his legatees and an engineer and would die in a German camp after the suppression of the Warsaw Uprising of August–October 1944.
Though Prus was a gifted writer, initially best known for his humorist work, early on he thought little of his journalistic and literary productions. Hence at the inception of his career in 1872, at age 25, he adopted for his newspaper columns and fiction the pen name "Prus"—"Prus I" being his family coat-of-arms—while reserving his actual name, Aleksander Głowacki, for "serious" writings.
In 1878 an incident occurred that illustrated the strong feelings that could be aroused in susceptible readers of newspaper columns. In one of his columns, Prus had criticized the loud and, in his view, inappropriate behavior of some youths at a lecture about the poet Wincenty Pol. The University of Warsaw students in question demanded that Prus retract what he had written. After he refused, on March 26, 1878, several of them surrounded him outside his home, to which he had just returned in the company of two fellow-writers, and one of the students, Jan Sawicki, slapped Prus in the face. Prus summoned police, but subsequently declined to press charges against the students. He remembered the incident, however; and seventeen years later, during his 1895 visit to Paris, he refused, by some accounts, to meet with one of his erstwhile assailants, whom he blamed for having "ruined [his] life," perhaps by having caused or exacerbated his agoraphobia.
In 1882 Prus succeeded the prophet of Polish Positivism, Aleksander Świętochowski, to the editorship of the Warsaw daily "Nowiny" (News). He resolved, in the best Positivist fashion, to make it "an observatory of societal facts"—an instrument for advancing the development of his country. After less than a year, however, "Nowiny" folded and Prus resumed writing columns. He continued working as a journalist to the very end of his life, even well after he had achieved success as an author of short stories and novels.
Fiction.
In time, Prus adopted the French Positivist critic Hippolyte Taine's concept of the arts, including literature, as a second means, alongside the sciences, of studying reality, and he devoted more attention to his sideline of short-story writer. Prus's stories, which met with great acclaim, owed much to the Polish novelist Józef Ignacy Kraszewski and, among foreign writers, to Charles Dickens and Mark Twain. His fiction would also be influenced by Victor Hugo, Gustave Flaubert, Alphonse Daudet and Émile Zola.
Prus wrote several dozen stories, ranging in length from micro-story to novella. Noted as characteristic of Prus's stories are his keen powers of observation of everyday life and his sense of humor, which he had honed early on as a contributor to humor magazines.
Eventually he would compose four novels on what he had referred to in an 1884 letter as "great questions of our day": "The Outpost" ("Placówka", 1886) on the Polish peasant; "The Doll" ("Lalka", 1889) on the aristocracy and townspeople and on idealists struggling to bring about social reforms; "The New Woman" ("Emancypantki", 1893) on feminist concerns; and his only historical novel, "Pharaoh" ("Faraon", 1895), on mechanisms of political power.
After having sold "Pharaoh" to the publishing firm of Gebethner and Wolff, Prus embarked on May 16, 1895, on a four-month journey abroad. He visited Berlin, Dresden, Karlsbad, Nuremberg, Stuttgart and Rapperswil. At the latter Swiss town he stayed two months (July–August), nursing his agoraphobia and spending much time with his friends, the promising young writer Stefan Żeromski and his wife Oktawia. The couple sought Prus's help for the Polish National Museum where Żeromski was librarian.
The final stage of Prus's journey took him to Paris, where he was prevented by his agoraphobia from crossing the Seine River to visit the city's southern Left Bank. He was nevertheless pleased to find that his descriptions of Paris in "The Doll" had been on the mark (he had based them mainly on French-language publications). From Paris he hurried home to recuperate at Nałęczów from his journey, the last that he would make abroad.
Later years.
Over the years, Prus lent his name and support to many charitable and social causes. There was one such event that he would come to regret, for the broad criticism that it brought him: it involved helping to welcome Russia's Tsar Nicholas II during an 1897 visit to Warsaw.
Prus's experiences in the January 1863 Uprising had persuaded him to urge society's advancement through work, learning and commerce rather than through potentially disastrous social upheavals. He departed from this stance, however, in 1905, when Tsarist Russia experienced defeat in the Russo-Japanese War and his compatriots demanded autonomy and reforms. On December 20, 1905, in the first issue of a short-lived new periodical, "Młodość" ("Youth"), he published an article, "Oda do młodości" ("Ode to Youth"), whose title harked back to, and was an updated paraphrase of, the 1820 poem by Adam Mickiewicz. In it Prus wrote, in reference to his earlier position on revolution and strikes: "... with the greatest pleasure I admit it—I was wrong!"
In 1908 Prus serialized in the Warsaw "Illustrated Weekly" ("Tygodnik Ilustrowany") his novel, "Children" ("Dzieci"), describing the young revolutionaries, terrorists and anarchists of the day; it was an uncharacteristically humorless work. Three years later a final novel, "Changes" ("Przemiany"), was to have been a panorama of the society and of its vital concerns, not unlike "The Doll". The beginning, however, had barely been serialized in the "Illustrated Weekly" in 1911-12 when the novel's composition was cut short by Prus's death. Neither of the two late novels is generally regarded as part of the essential Prus canon; the Polish writer Czesław Miłosz called "Children" one of Prus's weakest works.
Prus's last novel to meet with popular acclaim was "Pharaoh", completed in 1895. "Pharaoh", depicting the demise of ancient Egypt's Twentieth Dynasty and New Kingdom three thousand years earlier, had also reflected Poland's loss of independence a century before in 1795—an independence whose post-World War I restoration Prus would not live to see.
On May 19, 1912, in his Warsaw apartment at 12 Wolf Street ("ulica Wilcza 12"), Prus's forty-year journalistic and literary career ended with his death.
The beloved agoraphobic author was mourned by the nation that he had striven, as soldier, thinker and writer, to rescue from oblivion. Thousands attended his May 22, 1912, funeral service at St. Alexander's Church on nearby Triple Cross Square ("Plac Trzech Krzyży") and his interment at Powązki Cemetery.
Prus's tomb was designed by his nephew, the noted sculptor Stanisław Jackowski. On three sides, respectively, it bears the novelist's actual name, Aleksander Głowacki, his dates of birth and death, and his pen name Bolesław Prus. On the fourth side is the inscription "Serce serc" ("Heart of hearts"), borrowed from the Latin inscription ("Cor cordium") on the tomb of English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley in Rome's Protestant Cemetery. Below the inscription is the figure of a little girl embracing Prus's tomb — a figure emblematic of Prus's well-known empathy and affection for children.
Legacy.
On December 3, 1961, nearly half a century after Prus' death, a museum devoted to him was opened in the 18th-century Małachowski Palace at Nałęczów, near Lublin, a city in eastern Poland. It was at Nałęczów that Prus had vacationed for thirty years from 1882 until his death, and that he had met the young Stefan Żeromski. Prus had served as witness at Żeromski's 1892 wedding and had helped foster the younger man's writing career.
While Prus espoused a positivist and realist outlook, much in his fiction shows qualities compatible with pre-1863-Uprising Polish Romantic literature; indeed, he held the Polish Romantic poet Adam Mickiewicz in high regard. Prus's novels in turn, especially "The Doll" and "Pharaoh", with their innovative composition techniques, blazed the way for the 20th-century Polish novel.
"The Doll" was considered by Polish writer Czesław Miłosz to be the best Polish novel.
"The New Woman" was pronounced by Joseph Conrad, son of a precursor to the 1863 insurgents, Apollo Korzeniowski, to be "better than Dickens"—a favorite author of Conrad's. Milosz, however, thought "The New Woman" "as a whole... an artistic failure, perhaps because Prus... seems to have known little about women..." Curiously, Conrad too has been said by some critics to have fallen short in his portrayals of women.
"Pharaoh", a study of political power, became the favorite novel of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, prefigured the fate of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, and continues to point analogies to more recent times. "Pharaoh" is often described as Prus's "best-composed novel"—indeed, "one of the best-composed [of all] Polish novels."
"The Doll" and "Pharaoh", which made Prus a potential candidate for the Nobel Prize in literature, are available in English versions. "The Doll" has been translated into sixteen languages, and "Pharaoh" into twenty. In addition, "The Doll" has been filmed several times and been produced as a late-1970s television miniseries, while "Pharaoh" was adapted into a 1966 feature film.
In 1897-99 Prus serialized in the Warsaw "Daily Courier" ("Kurier Codzienny") a monograph on "The Most General Life Ideals" ("Najogólniejsze ideały życiowe"), which systematized ethical ideas that he had developed over his career regarding "happiness", "utility" and "perfection" in the lives of individuals and societies. In it he returned to the society-organizing (i.e., political) interests that had been frustrated during his "Nowiny" editorship fifteen years earlier. A book edition appeared in 1901 (2nd, revised edition, 1905). This work, rooted in Jeremy Bentham's Utilitarian philosophy and Herbert Spencer's view of society-as-organism, retains interest especially for philosophers and social scientists.
Another of Prus's learned projects remained incomplete at his death. He had sought over his writing career to develop a coherent theory of literary composition. Notes of his from 1886-1912 were never put together into a finished book as he had intended. Some particularly intriguing fragments describe Prus's combinatorial calculations of the millions of potential "individual types" of human characters, given a stated number of "individual traits."
A curious comparative-literature aspect has been noted to Prus's career, which paralleled that of his American contemporary, Ambrose Bierce (1842-1914). Each became a war casualty with combat head trauma—Prus in 1863 in the Polish 1863-65 Uprising; Bierce in 1864 in the American Civil War. Each experienced false starts in other occupations, and at twenty-five became a journalist for the next forty years; failed to sustain a career as editor-in-chief; achieved celebrity as a short-story writer; lost a son in tragic circumstances (Prus, an adopted son; Bierce, both his sons); attained superb humorous effects by portraying human egoism (Prus especially in "Pharaoh", Bierce in "The Devil's Dictionary"); was dogged from early adulthood by a health problem (Prus, agoraphobia; Bierce, asthma); and died within two years of the other (Prus in 1912; Bierce presumably in 1914). Prus, however, unlike Bierce, went on from short stories to write novels.
Notable works.
The following is a chronological list of works by Bolesław Prus. Translated titles, when available, are given, followed by original titles and dates of publication.
Notes.
a. In a January 1909 newspaper column, Prus discussed H.G. Wells' 1901 book, "Anticipations", including Wells' prediction that by the year 2000, following the defeat of German imperialism "on land and at sea," there would be a European Union that would reach eastward to include the western Slavs—the Poles, Czechs and Slovaks. The latter peoples, along with the Hungarians and six other countries, did in fact join the European Union in 2004.
b. Prus was not alone in advocating the development of science and technology. It was part of the spirit of the times. The great Polish mathematician Kazimierz Kuratowski writes that in the period when Poland was under complete foreign rule (1795–1918) "It was a common belief that the cultivation of science and the growth of its potential would somehow guarantee the [survival] of the [Polish] nation."
