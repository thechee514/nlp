SpongeBob SquarePants.
"SpongeBob SquarePants" is an Emmy-nominated American animated television series and media franchise. It is one of Nickelodeon's Nicktoons and is currently the most watched show on Nickelodeon. In 2007, it was named by TIME as one of the greatest television shows of all time. Although its original network is Nickelodeon, "SpongeBob" is now broadcast across the world. It was created by artist, animator, and former marine biologist, Stephen Hillenburg, and is produced through his production company, United Plankton Pictures, Inc.
The series is set in the Pacific Ocean, in the city of Bikini Bottom and on the surrounding lagoon floor. The pilot episode first aired in the United States on Nickelodeon after the "Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards" on May 1 1999. The "official" series premiere followed on July 17 1999 with the second episode, "Bubblestand/Ripped Pants."
Setting.
SpongeBob SquarePants is a sponge who lives in a pineapple under the sea, while his octopus neighbor Squidward Tentacles lives in a moai. SpongeBob's other neighbor and best friend is a pink starfish named Patrick Star, who lives under a rock. SpongeBob and Patrick live on either side of Squidward, much to Squidward's despair. Squidward is constantly annoyed by Spongebob and Patrick's antics.
SpongeBob and his friends live in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. Bikini Bottom is like a regular city with a downtown, suburbs, coastal areas, its own airport, bus system, and fair park. Stephen Hillenburg said once that Bikini Bottom was loosely based on Seattle, Washington. A good example of this statement is in the episode Pre-Hibernation Week. Sandy and SpongeBob were fighting on a tall structure called the Sea Needle, referring to the Space Needle, a tall structure in Seattle. Stephen has said that he wants to leave the location of Bikini Bottom to the imagination, claiming that the "Baywatch" scene was just a reference to his favorite show of all time.
SpongeBob's house-pet is a snail named Gary, whose "meow" is similar to a cat. Although Gary only speaks in a few episodes, the characters have shown an ability to understand him. In addition to this, underwater worms bark exactly like dogs, and are kept on chains. Jellyfish are the equivalent of bees; buzzing, stinging with poison (although it appears as an electric shock), and producing delicious "jelly", mocking the name "jellyfish", while still referring to a bee's honey. Fish act as the citizens of the community but, as a rule, are not important characters.
SpongeBob, who is absorbent, yellow, and porous, works as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab, a fast-food restaurant, with Squidward as the cashier. The Krusty Krab is owned by Eugene H. Krabs (Mr. Krabs).
Sheldon J. Plankton (commonly referred to as "Plankton") is Mr. Krabs's arch enemy who owns a low-rank fast-food restaurant called The Chum Bucket across the street from the Krusty Krab. The Chum Bucket has almost never had a customer, and Plankton spends most of his time plotting to steal the recipe for Mr. Krabs's popular Krabby Patty burgers. Only in the movie does he succeed; the formula is never actually revealed to the audience. Plankton's computer wife, Karen, alternately helps him in his schemes or bickers with him.
Sandy Cheeks is another friend of SpongeBob. She is a squirrel that lives in an underwater dome in Bikini Bottom. She was sent there by her bosses, chimpanzees. Sandy has a Texas accent and is also from there. Sometimes she gets a little home-sick and sings a little song. When not inside her tree-dome, she wears an astronaut-like suit because she cannot breathe in water. Sandy, just like a normal squirrel, hibernates once a year, as seen in a few episodes such as Prehibernation Week and Survival of the Idiots. She likes SpongeBob as much as SpongeBob likes her.
Instead of cars, the residents of Bikini Bottom drive boats. SpongeBob is still in boating school after failing the driving test over seventy-two times. Once, during an episode set in a wilderness area, Patrick questions how a camp fire is possible on the lagoon bottom. As soon as the question is asked, the fire is immediately extinguished with a sizzle. A flurry of bubbles accompanies actions in many of the episodes to remind the viewer that the setting is underwater. Ironically, when there is a separate body of water underwater, such as a swimming pool or lagoon, a non-car boat must be used to cross it because both SpongeBob and Patrick cannot swim, they must be taught by Larry the Lobster. In the episode "The Snowball Effect/One Krabs Trash" (Episode 46 Season 3) it snows in Bikini Bottom. The show also frequently ignores its underwater setting when dealing with water in other uses; Bikini Bottom has functional baths, pools, and toilets.
Popularity.
"SpongeBob SquarePants" is the only cartoon to consistently make the Top 10 list in the Nielsen ratings, and is the first "low budget" Nickelodeon cartoon, according to the network, to become extremely popular. Low-budget cartoons had not garnered as much esteem as higher-rated (and higher-budgeted) shows, such as "Rugrats", although when SpongeBob aired in 1999, it had gained a significant enough number of viewers in the ratings to be considered popular, eventually becoming more popular than "Rugrats" had ever been. SpongeBob follows other Nickelodeon shows that have attracted "older" followers: "The Ren & Stimpy Show", "Rocko's Modern Life", the "Kablam!" skits, "Action League Now!" and "The Angry Beavers". Other shows have followed in this trend as well: "Invader Zim" and "The Fairly OddParents" won a similar fan base when they aired in 2001, and the latter is now second only to SpongeBob in popularity, while the former was cancelled despite gaining a cult following. The show debuted in 1999, and during that time, DragonBall Z and Pokémon were still the biggest crazes. SpongeBob did not gain its popularity until around 2000, and it has remained popular since then. It has achieved the "Great" rating on tv.com, with a 8.7 rating, the third best rating in nickelodeon, the first being "Avatar" with a rating of 9.3 and the second being The Fairly Odd Parents with a rating of 8.8.
Broad appeal.
SpongeBob is one in a long line of cartoons that is designed to appeal to adults as well as children. This has a lot to do with the absurd way underwater life and situations are represented, and with the situations, references, and words used, which younger viewers might not understand. Certain innuendos also are intended to go over younger viewers' heads. For example, SpongeBob tried to show his grandma that he was a mature adult by wearing sideburns and a derby, and listening to 'free form jazz' or when Squidward tricked Spongebob and Patrick into thinking he was a ghost, a coral reef sculpted like Toulouse-Lautrec's can-can girls stands in the background (leading to a pun by Squidward), are jokes most children would not understand. Numerous marine biology in-jokes are woven into the show. There are also often complex ironic scenarios that need close attention.
While many newer cartoons revolve around pre-adolescents with strange lives and feature many pop-culture references (e.g. "The Fairly OddParents"), SpongeBob chooses to go for a formula that was used in highly successful older Nick cartoons such as "Ren and Stimpy" and "Rocko's Modern Life", with non-human young adults in crazy, unrealistic situations, with minimal pop culture references.
Part of the show's appeal has to do with the childlike nature of SpongeBob and his best friend, Patrick Star, both of whom are adults but display an innocence typical of human children. However, the characters are not immune from more adult avocations, including rock musicianship in a stadium performance, reminiscent of a hard rock concert, or Patrick turning to SpongeBob after they had nurtured a baby clam, holding his arms out saying "Lets have another".
Unlike the Nickelodeon network, SpongeBob features well-known independent musicians who contribute to its soundtrack. Alternative rock bands such as Wilco, The Shins, The Flaming Lips and Ween (who have contributed two original songs to the show and their 1997 song "Ocean Man" to the movie soundtrack), as well as metal bands Pantera, Motörhead and Twisted Sister have made appearances on the show and movies soundtracks, and heavy metal group Metallica even released a T-shirt featuring cartoon versions of themselves playing live with the characters SpongeBob and Patrick. British rock singer David Bowie was a special guest on the SpongeBob SquarePants episode Atlantis SquarePantis, which aired on November 12, 2007. The episode drew total 8.8 million viewers, the biggest audience in the show's eight-year history.
The TV movie Atlantis SquarePantis referenced numerous other movies or stories. David Bowie's character Lord Royal Highness (with his upper class accent) and the locals looked remarkably like the Blue Meanies (Yellow Submarine) - quite fitting for an underwater adventure. When the characters arrived at his habitat, he fell down as he proceeded down the red carpet (as Willy Wonka did in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, before leading them on a tour. A case can also be made for the yellow road used in the tour and a reference to "The Wizard of Oz" - along with the movie being a musical.
The show became so popular with adolescents and adults that the series was broadcast on MTV and featured on Spike TV. A quote by Patrick ("It's gonna rock!" from the episode Mid-Life Crustacean) has been used as a promotional tag-line for rock stations. Ren and Stimpy, among others, had followed a similar path. "The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie", released on November 19 2004, features a cameo appearance by actor David Hasselhoff, in a parody of his role from the "Baywatch" TV series.
Merchandising and marketing.
Merchandise based on the show ranges from Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, Go-Gurt, Kellogg's cereal, and video games to boxer shorts, flip-flops, pajamas, t-shirts, and slippers.
The show also spawned a large and popular merchandise line at Hot Topic, Claire's, RadioShack, Target, Wal-Mart and Toys "R" Us stores in the United States as well as the Zellers, Wal-Mart Canada and Toys "R" Us stores in Canada, and a limited selction of merchandise in Australia at Kmart Australia and Target Australia.
There have been kids meal tie-ins at Wendy's for SpongeBob's House Party Special in 2002 and at Burger King restaurants in 2001, 2003, and for the movie in 2004. In 2006, another kids meal tie-in for Burger King was introduced for the Lost in Time special, and in 2007 for the Friend or Foe? special featuring containers for BK Chicken Fries designed to look like SpongeBob. In November 2007, another Burger King Kids Meal will be released to tie-in with the new episode Atlantis SquarePantis.
A McDonald's Happy Meal tie-in with SpongeBob-themed Happy Meal boxes and toys has not been released in North America yet, but has already been released in Europe in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and also in Australia in early 2007 at about the same time a Catscratch Happy Meal was released in the United States and Canada. In Australia, the advertisement for the McDonald's SpongeBob Happy Meal won the Pester Power Award for the fact that the ads are enticing young children to want its food because of the free toy.
In Japan, they had a kids meal tie-in with KFC which featured different toys based on the TV series.
SpongeBob was also featured on VH1's ": " as part of a commentary by Michael Ian Black and "Weird Al" Yankovic among other celebrities.
A tie-in beverage for the SpongeBob SquarePants Movie in 2004 at 7-Eleven convenience stores has been created, a pineapple-flavored Slurpee, which has already been discontinued as of 2005.
Events in the past with the SpongeBob SquarePants theme include an exhibit at Underwater Adventures Aquarium in the Mall of America called SeaCrits of Bikini Bottom during the summer of 2003. In October 2004, a NASCAR Busch Series race was named The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie 300, presented by Lowe's and broadcast on TNT featuring Jimmie Johnson's #48 Lowe's stock car and Kyle Busch's #5 stock car painted for the race with the SpongeBob Movie paint schemes. There were contests tied in with the movie where fans could win SpongeBob-related items or a trip to the Cayman Islands.
The motion simulator/interactive movie ride "Escape from Dino-Island 3D" at Six Flags Over Texas was turned into "SpongeBob SquarePants 4-D", with water squirts, real bubbles, and other sensory enhancements. The SpongeBob SquarePants 4-D ride opened at the Noah's Ark Dive-In Theater located at Noah's Ark Waterpark in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin in the summer of 2007. LEGO received license to produce SpongeBob SquarePants building sets, which are available in stores now. SpongeBob will also appear at the Mall of America's new theme along with the rest of the Nicktoons in a new Nickelodeon theme park re-branded from the Mall of America's Park at MOA (formerly Camp Snoopy) to Nickelodeon Universe in the Minneapolis-St. Paul suburb of Bloomington, Minnesota. The new theme park will feature a SpongeBob-themed Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter roller coaster, the SpongeBob SquarePants Rock Bottom Plunge, which will replace the Mystery Mine Ride and Olde Tyme Photo store on the eastern end of the theme park. The theme park will open March 15, 2008.
In 2007, some new high-end SpongeBob-themed electronics have been introduced by Imation Electronics Products under the Npower brand, such as MP3 players, digital cameras, a DVD player, and a flatscreen television.
Other items featuring SpongeBob include a special edition Monopoly board game, Life and Operation board game as well as a SpongeBob SquarePants edition of Ants in the Pants and Yahtzee. SEGA Corporation introduced a ticket redemption game based on the show that has become popular with most video arcades.
The SpongeBob SquarePants market saturation has become something of a joke. In the comic strip "Sherman's Lagoon", Hawthorne the crab is showing off a small nuclear (Junior) reactor, and Herman the shark says "Boy, that SpongeBob will endorse anything!"
When the complete first season of SpongeBob SquarePants was released in the United Kingdom, it included some heavy editing (though not to the cartoons themselves). The audio commentaries were cut out, and only two extras were left in, possibly to avoid a 12 rating. A similar approach was taken with the second season; it included no audio commentaries and only one extra, Around the World with SpongeBob SquarePants.
Development (1993 – 1999).
"SpongeBob's" history can be traced back to 1993 when "Rocko's Modern Life" first aired. One of the producers was Stephen Hillenburg, a cartoon worker/marine biologist who loved both his careers. When "Rocko's Modern Life" was canceled in 1996, Hillenburg began working on "SpongeBob" (although sketches trace back to 1987). He teamed up with creative director Derek Drymon, who had worked on shows such as "Doug", "Action League Now!", and "Hey Arnold!". Drymon had worked with Hillenburg on "Rocko's Modern Life" as well, as did many SpongeBob crew members, including writer-directors Sherm Cohen and Dan Povenmire, writer Tim Hill, voice actors Tom Kenny and Doug Lawrence (aka "Mr. Lawrence"), actor-writer Martin Olson and animation director Alan Smart. Another crew member with previous Nickelodeon cartoon experience was former "Angry Beavers" story editor Merriwether Williams, who worked on that show for its first few seasons and switched to "SpongeBob" in July 1999.
During production of the show, Bobson provided a concept of short comics with the same style of the show, but the characters looked different. "SpongeBob" used to be named "SpongeBoy", and used to wear a red hat with a green base and a white business shirt with a tie. The name "SpongeBoy" did not make it into the show since the name was already officially trademarked by Bob Burden, creator of "Flaming Carrot". Hillenburg later chose the alternative name "SpongeBob". The original name was once referenced in the show by Mr. Krabs' line, "SpongeBoy, me Bob!." The Krusty Krab was originally spelled with the letter C rather than K, but Stephen Hillenburg thought Ks were funnier and it would fit his Ukrainian heritage.
Rise In Popularity (1999 - 2000).
"SpongeBob" aired its first episode, "Help Wanted/Reef Blower/Tea at the Treedome", after the 1999 "Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards". At this time, "Rugrats" was the most popular show on Nickelodeon and had already outlived dozens of other lower-budget cartoons. SpongeBob, with its generally lower-class animation and humor style more rooted in clever word-play and culture-references unlike the potty humor that made "Rugrats" so popular, was expected to be just another one of those shows. Following early struggles, its ratings soared, and a year after release, it surpassed "Rugrats" as Nickelodeon's highest rated show. "SpongeBobs signature voice (provided by Tom Kenny) and humorous style was enjoyable to both younger and older audiences.
Peak years (2000 – 2003).
The show began its second season in 2000 with more high-quality animation and even more popular episodes. By then it was clear to the world that SpongeBob had opened the door to many other cartoons to use more "adult" senses of humor and come from smaller companies. In 2001, The Fairly OddParents aired from the then-small Frederator company. It focused on a sense of humor similar to SpongeBob’s, only more realistic, slightly crazier (and more suggestive to "adult" topics), and with more pop culture references; this show managed to become a hit as well and currently ranks behind SpongeBob as Nick's second most popular show. That same year, Invader Zim aired, created by comic book writer Jhonen Vasquez; it had a dark but silly sense of humor (similar to Vasquez's other comic books) that managed to attract a very loyal cult following consisting more of teens and adults than young children (Though also containing a moderate amount of preteens). SpongeBob, however, was the leader of all these shows and had by this time started its now famous merchandise line.
The first part of 2002 saw SpongeBob at its peak. The beginning of the third season produced many of classic episodes and focused on the same style and animation concepts as the second season.
Unfortunately, things changed late in the year. Due to rumors of a movie, there was high speculation that the show would be canceled and that 2002 would feature the last season of new episodes. Fans were devastated and online petitions were widely distributed to convince Nickelodeon to produce more episodes by showing continuing fan support. "SpongeBob Meets The Strangler/Pranks A Lot" was the last episode of this season, and aired in October 2004. It was also released on DVD at the end of 2003. Following this, the movie was released in November 2004.
Hiatus and movie era (2003 – 2005).
A hiatus from 2003 to 2005 challenged viewer loyalty. This was before the program's lowest ratings with Survival of the Idiots on March 5, 2001 aired, causing speculation that the show might even be cancelled after the movie's release.
The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie earned over $85,000,000 in revenue in the United States, considered to be under-expectations: People assumed that the show's popularity showed something of a decline at the time of its release. However, unlike The Rugrats Movie (which was considered to be Rugrats jump the shark moment), the "SpongeBob" movie was actually generally well received by fans who saw it.
It was announced late in 2004 that SpongeBob would be continuing with a new season due in 2005. Hillenburg, despite the rumors, did not actually leave the show but has resigned from his position as the show's executive producer (this job now belongs to Derek Drymon, with Paul Tibbitt taking over Drymon's job as creative director.
Comeback (2005 – Present).
TV advertisements for "SpongeBobs fourth season first aired publicly during the 2005 "Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards". The new episodes began airing on May 6, 2005. The first new episode of Season 4 was "Fear of a Krabby Patty"/"Shell of a Man". After airing three new episodes on Fridays from May 6 – May 20, Nickelodeon showed no new episodes until September 2005.
For the first time in the series' run, Nickelodeon began airing 11-minute segments of new episodes separately, spread over two weeks. This practice began with the airing of the episode "Selling Out" on September 23; its companion episode, "Funny Pants," premiered the following week.
The Star Online eCentral reported in December 2005 that Nickelodeon had ordered 20 more episodes, bringing the show’s total to 100.
"Spongebob SquarePants" has been approved for a sixth season, which consists of thirteen episodes.
Nickelodeon aired the special "Have You Seen This Snail?" in November 2005. However, it was not until February 2006 that new episodes resumed, starting with "Dunces and Dragons" and continuing until June 2 2006. Further new episodes appeared during September 2006 ("New Leaf" and "Once Bitten"), October ("Wigstruck"), and November ("The Best Day Ever" — drawing 6.7 million viewers — the Best Day Ever was a 25-hour 100-episode Spongebob TV event ending with the Spongebob Squarepants Movie although the Nickelodeon narrator made a goof about the marathon being 24 hours instead of the actual 25 hours. Fans voted for Karate Island as the most popular Spongebob episode. The Best 10 Ever airs after the Best Day Ever.
The new episodes in 2007 started airing on January 15, showing three new episodes back to back on February 19, 2007, officially beginning the airing of the fifth season which featured more potty humor than previously shown. On July 23, 2007 Nickelodeon aired a special event, called the "Spongebob New-New-New-New-New Week" in which from Monday to Friday, a new episode of season five (except for Squid Wood, from season four) would air. This continued until the end of the second week.
On November 12, 2007 SpongeBob's first TV movie, "Atlantis SquarePantis" premiered, after a SpongeBob marathon. A behind the scenes feature aired after the movie. Also on November 23, 2007, there was another SpongeBob marathon including a rerun of Atlantis SquarePantis and four new episodes. Season Six officially premiered with five new 11-minute episodes airing in a marathon from March 3 to March 7, 2008. There are still some episodes from the fifth production season which have yet to air.
Magazine.
In the United Kingdom, a SpongeBob SquarePants magazine is currently being published by Titan Magazines every four weeks. It was first published on February 3 2005. The next issue was published on February 1 2007 and was the second anniversary of the magazine. The magazine contains comic strips, fan letters, competitions and several features including games.
