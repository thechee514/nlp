Birthday party.
A "birthday party" is a celebration that occurs to celebrate the birth of the person honored. Birthday parties are celebrated in many cultures. While a child's party is usually at home and consists of soft drinks and sweet food as well as savory, adults' birthday parties in Western countries often take place in bars or nightclubs where a range of alcoholic beverages are consumed.
In Western cultures, particularly in the United States, birthday parties are often accompanied by colorful decorations such as streamers and balloons. A birthday cake is often served with candles that are to be blown out after a "birthday wish" has been made. While the birthday cake is brought to the table, the song "Happy Birthday to You" is sung. Wealthy people or celebrities may hire an event management agency or a party service to organize a birthday party.

A housewarming party is held when a person, couple, or family moves into a new house or apartment. It is an occasion for the hosts to present their new home to their friends, and for friends to gather, socialize, and enjoy refreshments such as alcoholic drinks and snack foods.

A dinner party is a formal social gathering at which people eat dinner together, usually in the host's own home. At the least formal dinner parties, a buffet of food is provided on a table or counter, and the guests choose items from the buffet and eat standing up as they talk and mingle. At the most formal dinner parties, dinner is served at a dining table with place settings. Dinner parties are sometimes preceded by a cocktail party, a social gathering in a living room or bar where guests drink alcoholic cocktails as they mingle. Women guests may wear cocktail dresses. Cocktail parties are often held as a prelude to a dinner party.

Parties for teenagers and young adults.
Parties that are mainly held by teenagers and young adults include house parties, dance parties, and outdoor parties. In many areas of the world, the term house party refers to a type of party where large groups of people get together at a private house to socialize and consume drugs or/and alcoholic beverages. House parties which center around the consumption of beer which is pumped from a keg into plastic cups are called keg parties (or "Keggers"). These parties are popular in the US amongst college students, but are technically illegal for anyone under the age of 21 to attend, and often, even older party-goers run afoul of the law for violating ordinances regulating noise and disorderly conduct, or for operating a "blind pig".
"Dance parties" are gatherings in bars or community centers where the guests dance to pop and dance music such as house music, Disco, or techno. The music for dance parties is usually selected and played by a DJ over a PA system or a powerful stereo system. Conversation is not an integral part of these parties as those who attend express themselves through their dancing and by gesturing.A spinoff of the standard "dance party", the rave involves dancing to loud house music or techno music played by a DJ over a PA system. Rave parties can involve a few hundred people in a club, thousands of dancers in a large warehouse, or in huge rave parties, such as the Berlin Love Parade over a hundred thousand partygoers.
Outdoor parties include bush parties and beach parties. Bush parties are a social event held in a secluded area of forest (or "bush") in which friends gather to drink beer and liquor and talk. These parties are often held around a bonfire to provide a source of light and warmth. Bush parties are widely associated with underage drinking. A beach party is usually held on a sandy shoreline of a lake, river, or sea, and the gathering often centers around a bonfire.
A "crush party" is a party in a sorority or fraternity where sisters or brothers get a certain number of invitations (supposedly their "crushes") to give out to their friends who are not in their house to give to the "crushes" and they get invited without knowing who invited them. There can be some sort of revealing at the party where the guests find out who has a crush on them.

Cast party.
A cast party is a celebration following the last performance of a theatrical event, such as an opera, musical, or play. It may also take place following the end of shooting for a motion picture, where it is also known as a wrap party, or following the final episode of a television series for the season. The party is often exclusive to the performers and crew members, with a smaller number of guests who did not themselves participate in the performance. Cast parties are traditional for almost all acted performances, including amateur events such as high school plays.
Pre-party.
A "pre-party", also known as "pre-gaming" or "pre-funking", is an informal name for a party held prior to main events including: school dances, weddings, birthday parties, raves, or bar/bat mitzvahs. These are usually short and sometimes involve guests getting ready (putting on makeup, clothes, etc.) for the main event. After a pre-party, the guests usually leave at the same time to arrive at the main event together. Often, "pre-gaming" includes drinking alcohol before the party so one is "buzzed" before the actual party.
After party.
An "after-party" is the informal name for a cast party, used in the professional music performance community. After parties are usually coordinated by the performers, and invitations are very selective. Only the performers, crew members and a small number of outside friends are invited.
After-parties can also be held after school dances, bar/bat mitzvahs, weddings, and other large parties. However, only a few select close friends of the host would be invited to the after party instead of all the people who were invited to the primary event.
The term is now used to advertise a club's affiliation with an event, in the hopes that people will go to the club afterwards to continue partying after the primary event is over. In smaller shows, these "after-parties" hosted by clubs will also attract the performers who may be on tour and thus not have a place to host a party.
Traditional parties.
"Traditional parties" such as the English tea party or the modern cocktail party, are social gatherings within a fairly formal, or at least stylized, atmosphere. These parties often have roots in tradition which can be regional, cultural, or specific to a single family. Religious celebrations like that accompanying the Jewish Brit milah and the coming of age celebration of Bar and Bat Mitzvahs are usually accompanied by a traditional party.
Fund raising party.
These parties are focused around the act of rising money for a person or institution, often used to raise money for political campaigns, schools, businesses, and charities. These parties are usually formal in nature, consisting of a dinner followed by speeches or presentations extolling the cause for which funds are being raised.
