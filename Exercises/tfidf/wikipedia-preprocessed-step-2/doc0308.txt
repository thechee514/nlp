Cartesian coordinate system.
In mathematics, the Cartesian coordinate system (also called rectangular coordinate system) is used to determine each point uniquely in a plane through two numbers, usually called the "x-coordinate" or abscissa and the "y-coordinate" or ordinate of the point. To define the coordinates, two perpendicular directed lines (the "x-axis", and the "y-axis"), are specified, as well as the unit length, which is marked off on the two axes (see Figure 1). Cartesian coordinate systems are also used in space (where three coordinates are used) and in higher dimensions.
Using the Cartesian coordinate system, geometric shapes (such as curves) can be described by algebraic equations, namely equations satisfied by the coordinates of the points lying on the shape. For example, the circle of radius 2 may be described by the equation x2 + y2 = 4 (see Figure 2).
History.
Cartesian means relating to the French mathematician and philosopher René Descartes (Latin: "Cartesius"), who, among other things, worked to merge algebra and Euclidean geometry. This work was influential in the development of analytic geometry, calculus, and cartography.
The idea of this system was developed in 1637 in two writings by Descartes and independently by Pierre de Fermat, although Fermat did not publish the discovery. In part two of his Discourse on Method, Descartes introduces the new idea of specifying the position of a point or object on a surface, using two intersecting axes as measuring guides. In "La Géométrie", he further explores the above-mentioned concepts.
Two-dimensional coordinate system ==.
A Cartesian coordinate system in two dimensions is commonly defined by two axes, at right angles to each other, forming a plane (an "xy"-plane). The horizontal axis is normally labeled "x", and the vertical axis is normally labeled "y". In a three dimensional coordinate system, another axis, normally labeled "z", is added, providing a third dimension of space measurement. The axes are commonly defined as mutually orthogonal to each other (each at a right angle to the other). (Early systems allowed "oblique" axes, that is, axes that did not meet at right angles, and such systems are occasionally used today, although mostly as theoretical exercises.) All the points in a Cartesian coordinate system taken together form a so-called Cartesian plane. Equations that use the Cartesian coordinate system are called Cartesian equations.
The point of intersection, where the axes meet, is called the "origin" normally labeled "O".
The "x" and "y" axes define a plane that is referred to as the "xy" plane.
Given each axis, choose a unit length, and mark off each unit along the axis, forming a grid.
To specify a particular point on a two dimensional coordinate system, indicate the "x" unit first (abscissa), followed by the "y" unit (ordinate'") in the form ("x","y"), an ordered pair.
The choice of letters comes from a convention, to use the latter part of the alphabet to indicate unknown values. In contrast, the first part of the alphabet was used to designate known values.
An example of a point "P" on the system is indicated in Figure 3, using the coordinate (3,5).
The intersection of the two axes creates four regions, called quadrants, indicated by the Roman numerals I (+,+), II (−,+), III (−,−), and IV (+,−). Conventionally, the quadrants are labeled counter-clockwise starting from the upper right ("northeast") quadrant. In the first quadrant, both coordinates are positive, in the second quadrant "x"-coordinates are negative and "y"-coordinates positive, in the third quadrant both coordinates are negative and in the fourth quadrant, "x"-coordinates are positive and "y"-coordinates negative (see table below.)
Three-dimensional coordinate system.
The three dimensional Cartesian coordinate system provides the three physical dimensions of space — length, width, and height. Figures 4 and 5 show two common ways of representing it.
The three Cartesian axes defining the system are perpendicular to each other. The relevant coordinates are of the form "(x,y,z)". As an example, figure 4 shows two points plotted in a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system: "P"(3,0,5) and "Q"(−5,−5,7). The axes are depicted in a "world-coordinates" orientation with the "z"-axis pointing up.
The "x"-, "y"-, and "z"-coordinates of a point can also be taken as the distances from the "yz"-plane, "xz"-plane, and "xy"-plane respectively. Figure 5 shows the distances of point P from the planes.
The "xy"-, "yz"-, and "xz"-planes divide the three-dimensional space into eight subdivisions known as octants, similar to the quadrants of 2D space. While conventions have been established for the labelling of the four quadrants of the "x"-"y" plane, only the first octant of three dimensional space is labelled. It contains all of the points whose "x", "y", and "z" coordinates are positive.
The "z"-coordinate is also called applicate'".
In two dimensions.
Fixing or choosing the "x"-axis determines the "y"-axis up to direction. Namely, the "y"-axis is necessarily the perpendicular to the "x"-axis through the point marked 0 on the "x"-axis. But there is a choice of which of the two half lines on the perpendicular to designate as positive and which as negative. Each of these two choices determines a different orientation (also called "handedness") of the Cartesian plane.
The usual way of orienting the axes, with the positive "x"-axis pointing right and the positive "y"-axis pointing up (and the "x"-axis being the "first" and the "y"-axis the "second" axis) is considered the "positive" or "standard" orientation, also called the "right-handed" orientation.
A commonly used mnemonic for defining the positive orientation is the "right hand rule". Placing a somewhat closed right hand on the plane with the thumb pointing up, the fingers point from the "x"-axis to the "y"-axis, in a positively oriented coordinate system.
The other way of orienting the axes is following the "left hand rule", placing the left hand on the plane with the thumb pointing up.
Regardless of the rule used to orient the axes, rotating the coordinate system will preserve the orientation. Switching the role of "x" and "y" will reverse the orientation.
In three dimensions.
Once the "x"- and "y"-axes are specified, they determine the line along which the "z"-axis should lie, but there are two possible directions on this line. The two possible coordinate systems which result are called 'right-handed' and 'left-handed'. The standard orientation, where the "xy"-plane is horizontal and the "z"-axis points up (and the "x"- and the "y"-axis form a positively oriented two-dimensional coordinate system in the "xy"-plane if observed from "above" the "xy"-plane) is called right-handed or positive.
The name derives from the right-hand rule. If the index finger of the right hand is pointed forward, the middle finger bent inward at a right angle to it, and the thumb placed at a right angle to both, the three fingers indicate the relative directions of the "x"-, "y"-, and "z"-axes in a "right-handed" system. The thumb indicates the "x"-axis, the index finger the "y"-axis and the middle finger the "z"-axis. Conversely, if the same is done with the left hand, a left-handed system results.
Figure 7 is an attempt at depicting a left- and a right-handed coordinate system. Because a three-dimensional object is represented on the two-dimensional screen, distortion and ambiguity result. The axis pointing downward (and to the right) is also meant to point "towards" the observer, whereas the "middle" axis is meant to point "away" from the observer. The red circle is "parallel" to the horizontal "xy"-plane and indicates rotation from the "x"-axis to the "y"-axis (in both cases). Hence the red arrow passes "in front of" the "z"-axis.
Figure 8 is another attempt at depicting a right-handed coordinate system. Again, there is an ambiguity caused by projecting the three-dimensional coordinate system into the plane. Many observers see Figure 8 as "flipping in and out" between a convex cube and a concave "corner". This corresponds to the two possible orientations of the coordinate system. Seeing the figure as convex gives a left-handed coordinate system. Thus the "correct" way to view Figure 8 is to imagine the "x"-axis as pointing "towards" the observer and thus seeing a concave corner.
Representing a vector in the standard basis.
formula_3
where formula_4, formula_5, and formula_6 are unit vectors that point the same direction as the formula_7, formula_8, and formula_9 axes, respectively. This is the quaternion representation of the vector, and was introduced by Sir William Rowan Hamilton. The unit vectors formula_4, formula_5, and formula_6 are called the versors of the coordinate system, and are the vectors of the standard basis in three-dimensions.
Applications.
Cartesian coordinates are often used to represent two or three dimensions of space, but they can also be used to represent many other quantities (such as mass, time, force, etc.). In such cases the coordinate axes will typically be labelled with other letters (such as "m", "t", "F", etc.) in place of "x", "y", and "z". Each axis may also have different units of measurement associated with it (such as kilograms, seconds, pounds, etc.). It is also possible to define coordinate systems with more than three dimensions to represent relationships between more than three quantities. Although four- and higher-dimensional spaces are difficult to visualize, the algebra of Cartesian coordinates can be extended relatively easily to four or more variables, so that certain calculations involving many variables can be done. (This sort of algebraic extension is what is used to define the geometry of higher-dimensional spaces, which can become rather complicated.) Conversely, it is often helpful to use the geometry of Cartesian coordinates in two or three dimensions to visualize algebraic relationships between two or three (perhaps two or three of many) non-spatial variables.
Further notes.
In computational geometry the Cartesian coordinate system is the foundation for the algebraic manipulation of geometrical shapes. Many other coordinate systems have been developed since Descartes. One common set of systems use polar coordinates; astronomers and physicists often use spherical coordinates, a type of three-dimensional polar coordinate system.
It may be interesting to note that some have indicated that the master artists of the Renaissance used a grid, in the form of a wire mesh, as a tool for breaking up the component parts of their subjects they painted. That this may have influenced Descartes is merely speculative. (See perspective, projective geometry.)
