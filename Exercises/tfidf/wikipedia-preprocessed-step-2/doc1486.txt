Lviv.
Lviv (Ukrainian: Львів, "L’viv",;;; see also other names) is a major city in western Ukraine, the administrative center of Lviv Oblast, and designated as its own raion (district) within that oblast. It is regarded as one of the main cultural centres of Ukraine. In 2001, it had 725,000 inhabitants, of which 88% were Ukrainians, 9% Russians and 1% Poles, with a further 200,000 commuting daily from suburbs.
The city has many industries and institutions of higher education such as the Lviv University and the Lviv Polytechnic. It has a philharmonic orchestra and The Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet. The historic city centre is on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Lviv celebrated its 750th anniversary with a light show in the center of the city on September 2006.
Location.
Lviv is on the verge of the Roztochia Upland, about 70km from the Polish border and about 160km (100 miles) from the eastern Carpathian Mountains. Lviv's altitude averages 296m above sea level, although it has many hills. Its highest point is the "Vysokyi Zamok" (High Castle), 409m above sea level. This has a commanding view of the historic city center with its distinctive green-domed churches and intricate architecture.
The old walled city was at the foothills of the High Castle on the banks of the river Poltva. In the 13th century, the river was used to transport goods. In the early 20th century, it was covered in areas where it flows through the city. The central street of Lviv, Freedom Avenue ("Prospect Svobody") runs right above the river and the famous Opera House.
Climate.
Lviv's climate is moderate continental. The average temperatures are −4°C (27°F) in January and +18°C (65 °F) in June. Average annual rainfall is 660mm (26 inches), with a notable deficit in summer. Cloud coverage averages 66 days per year.
History.
Lviv was founded by King Danylo Halytskiy of the Ruthenian principality of Halych-Volhynia, and named in honor of his son, Lev. When Danylo died Lev made Lviv the capital of Halich-Volhynia. The city is first mentioned in Halych-Volhynian Chronicle from 1256. It was captured by Poland in 1349 and, in 1356, Casimir III of Poland brought in German burghers and granted the Magdeburg rights which implied that all city matters were to be resolved by a council, elected by the wealthy citizens. The city council seal of the 14th century stated: S(igillum): "Civitatis Lembvrgensis". As part of Poland (and later the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Lviv became the capital of the Ruthenian Voivodeship.
As Lviv prospered, it became religiously and ethnically diverse. The 17th century brought invading armies of Swedes, Hungarians from Transilvania, Russians and Cossacks to its gates. However, Lviv was the only major city of Poland, that was not captured by the invaders. In 1672 it was besieged by the Turks, who failed to conquer it, either. For the first time Lviv was captured by a foreign army in 1704, when Swedes under King Charles XII entered the city after a siege.
In 1772, following the First Partition of Poland, the city known as "Lemberg" became the capital of the Austrian Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. It was captured by the Russian army in September 1914 but retaken by Austria-Hungary in June the following year.
With the collapse of the Habsburg Empire at the end of World War I, Lviv became an arena of conflict between the local Ukrainian and Polish populations. Between the World Wars, it was the third largest Polish city (after Warsaw and Łódź) and the seat of the Lwów Voivodeship. Lviv and its population suffered greatly from the two world wars and the Holocaust. In the city of Lviv, Ukrainian nationalists allegedly organized two large pogroms in June-July, 1941 in which around 6,000 Jews were murdered, in apparent retribution for the alleged collaboration of some Jews with the previous Soviet regime. After the war, most of the ethnic Polish population was expelled and resettled in the Recovered Territories.
It remains today one of the main centres of Ukrainian culture and the origin of much of the nation's political class.
Buses.
The public bus network is not well-developed: it has few lines. A cheap alternative are the marshrutki, small private buses which go where the city buses do not. Marshrutki have no fixed stops or timetable but are cheaper (1,25 hryvnia ≈25US cents) and fast. The marshrutki also run on suburban lines to most nearby towns e.g. to Shehyni at the Polish border.
Tramways.
The first tramway lines were opened on 5th May 1880 and the last horse-powered line was electrified on 31st May 1894. In 1922, the tramways were switched to a right-hand-side system. After World War II and the annexation of the city by the Soviet Union, several lines were closed but most of infrastructure was preserved. The trackage is narrow-gauge, unusual for the Soviet Union, but explained by the fact that the system was built while the city was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and needs to run on narrow medieval streets in the center of town.
The Lviv tramway now runs about 220 cars on 75km of track, most of which is in very poor condition. The trams are in fair condition but can be very full during rush hours. A ticket for one journey (any distance) costs 0.6 hryvnia (≈12 US cents).
Trolleybuses.
After the war and expulsion of most of the population, the city grew rapidly, due to evacuees returning from Russia and the Soviet Government's vigorous development of heavy industry. This included transfer of entire factories from the Urals and other distant places to the newly "freed" ("acquired") territories of the USSR, including Lviv.
The city centre tramway lines were replaced with trolleybuses on 27th November 1952. Later, new lines were opened to the blocks of flats at the city outskirts. The network now runs 200 trolleybuses, mostly of the 1960s 14Tr type. A ticket for one journey (any distance) costs 0.6 hryvnia (≈12 US cents).
Railway.
Modern Lviv remains a hub on which nine railways converge, providing local and international services. Several trains cross the nearby Polish-Ukrainian border (mostly via Przemyśl). There are good connections to Slovakia (Košice) and Hungary (Budapest). By western standards, the trains are slow. Many routes have overnight trains with sleeping compartments.
Airport.
Lviv International Airport (LWO) is 6km from the city centre.
Architecture.
Lviv's historic churches, synagogues, buildings and relics date from the 13th century. In recent centuries, it was spared some of the invasions and wars that destroyed other Ukrainian cities. Its architecture reflects various European styles and periods. After the fires of 1527 and 1556, Lviv lost most of its gothic-style buildings, but it retains many buildings in renaissance, baroque, and classic styles. There are works by artists of the Vienna Secession, Art Nouveau, and Art Deco styles.
The buildings have many stone sculptures and carvings, particularly on large doors, hundreds of years old. The remains of old churches dot the central cityscape. Some 3-5 story buildings have hidden inner courtyards and grottos in various states of repair. Some cemeteries are of interest, for example the Lychakivskiy Cemetery. Leaving the central area, the architectural style changes radically as Soviet-era high rises dominate. In the centre, the Soviet era is reflected mainly in a few modern-style national monuments and sculptures.
Monuments in Lviv.
Every day the book market takes places around the monument to Ivan Fedorov. He was a Russian typographer in the 16th century who fled Moscow and found a new home in Lviv. New ideas came to Lviv during the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In the 19th century, many publishing houses, newspapers and magazines were established. Diverse literature written in Lviv contributed to Austria, Ukrainian, Yiddish and Polish literature. Translation work took place between these diverse cultures, creating a truly unique European culture that transcended borders. The annual Lviv Book Fair continues this tradition.
Religion.
Since its establishment Lemberg was a city of the religious variety and the conflicts between different faiths. At one point over 60 churches existed in the city. The largest Christian churches existed in the city since the 13th century. The Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Lviv, the German-speaking and Polish Catholics and the Armenian church, all three groups had their bishops-seat in Lviv since the 16th century. In 1700's, the orthodox community took their allegiance to the Pope in Rome and became the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. This bond was forcibly dissolved in 1946 by the Soviet authorities, while the Roman-catholic community was forced away by the expulsion of the Polish population. Since 1989 the religious life in Lviv has experienced a revival.
Lviv is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv, the centre of the Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine and (until 21st August 2005) was the centre of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. About 35% of religious buildings belong to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, 11.5% to the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, 9% to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchate and 6% to the Roman Catholic Church.
Until 2005, Lviv was the only city with two Cardinals: Lubomyr Husar (UGCC) and Marian Jaworski (RCC).
In June 2001, Pope John Paul II visited the Latin Cathedral, St. George's Cathedral, and the Armenian Cathedral.
Lviv historically had a large and active Jewish community, as witnessed today by its synagogues. Until 1941, at least 45 synagogues and prayer houses existed. Already since the 16th century, two separate communities existed. One lived in today's old town, the other one in the Krakowskie Przedmieście. In the 19th century a more differentiated community started to spread out. Liberal Jews sought more cultural assimilation and spoke German and Polish language. On the other hand, orthodox and hassidic Jews tried to retain the old traditions. Between 1941 to 1944, the Nazis in effect completely wiped out and destroyed the centuries-old Jewish tradition of Lviv. Most synagogues were destroyed, the Jewish population forced into a Ghetto from where they were later transported into concentration camps where they were murdered.
Under the Soviet Union synagogues remained closed and used as storage facilities or movie houses. Only since the Fall of the Iron Curtain has the remainder of the Jewish community experienced a faint revival.
Another institute that was and is renowned in the region is the Lviv Polytechnic (in Polish: "Politechnika Lwowska").
Arts.
The "Group Artes" was a young movement founded in 1929. Many of the artists studied in Paris and have travelled throughout in Europe. They worked and experimented in different areas of modern art: Futurism, Cubism, New Objectivity and Surrealism. A lot of cooperation took place between avant-garde musicians and authors. Altogether thirteen exhibitions by Artes took place in Warsaw, Krakow, Łódz and Lviv. The Nazi occupation placed an end to this group. Otto Hahn was executed in 1942 in Lviv, Aleksander Riemer murdered in 1943 in Auschwitz. Henryk Streng and Margit Reich-Sielska were able to escape the Shoah. Most of the surviving members of Artes lived in Poland after 1945. Only Margit Reich-Sielska (1900-1980) and Roman Sielksi (1903-1990) stayed in Soviet Lviv.
Theatre and opera.
Lviv is historically strong on culture. In 1842 the Skarbek-Theatre was opened, making it the third largest house in Central Europe. In 1903, the sumptuous opera house (back then still called the City-Theatre) was openend, emulating the Vienna State Opera house. The house initially offered a changing repertoire such as classical dramas in German and Polish language, opera, operetta, comedy, and theatre. The opera house is named after the diva Salomea Krushelnytska, who worked here.
Museums and art galleries.
The most notable of the museums and art galleries are the National Gallery, the Museum of Religion (formerly the Museum of Atheism) and the National Museum (formerly the Museum of Industry).
Music.
Music and Radio has a strong tradition and deep roots in Lviv. The opera diva Salomea Kruszelnicka in the 1920's to 30's called Lviv her home. "Polskie Radio Lwów" was a Polish radio station that went on-air on January 15, 1930. The programme proved very popular in Poland. Classical music and entertainment was aired, as well as lectures, readings, youth-programmes, news and liturgical services on Sunday.
Popular throughout Poland was the "Comic Lviv Wave", a cabaret-revue with musical pieces. Jewish artists contributed a great part to this artistic activity. Composers such as Henryk Wars and songwriter Emanuel Szlechter, the actor Mieczyslaw Monderer and Adolf Fleischer ("Aprikosenkranz und Untenbaum") were working in Lviv. The most famous stars of the shows were Henrik Vogelfänger and Kazimierz Wajda, who together appeared as the comic duo "Szczepko and Tonko", who were similar to Laurel and Hardy.
After World War II, many of the Jewish artists and entertainers were either killed or fled, the Polish artists had to leave for Poland in its borders drawn by Stalin.
Lviv is the hometown of the Eurovision Song Contest 2004 winner Ruslana, who has since become well-known in Europe.
Universities and academia.
Lviv University is one of the oldest ones in Central Europe. Its founding goes back as a Jesuit school in 1608. Its prestige greatly increased through the work of philosopher Kazimierz Twardowski (1866–1938), one of the founders of the Lwow-Warsaw School of Logic. This school of thought set benchmarks of academic research and education in Poland. Very well-known were the mathematicians Stefan Banach, Juliusz Schauder and Stanislaw Ulam, who turned Lviv in the 1930's into the "World Centre of Functional Analysis". Although the scientists faced many obstacles at the universities, their share in Lviv academia was very substantial.
Mathematics.
Lviv is the home of the Scottish Café, where, in the 1930s and the early 1940s, Polish mathematicians from the Lwów School of Mathematics met and spent their afternoons discussing mathematical problems. Stanislaw Ulam (later, a participant in the Manhattan Project and the proposer of the Teller-Ulam design of thermonuclear weapons), Stefan Banach (one of the founders of functional analysis), Hugo Steinhaus, Karol Borsuk, Kazimierz Kuratowski, Mark Kac, and many other famous mathematicians would gather there. The café, originally on Akamemichna, is now called the "Desertniy Bar", and is located at 27, Taras Shevchenko Prospekt.
Prints and media.
Starting in the 1900's a new movement started under with young authors from Eastern Europe. Especially young Jewish authors were searching for a new identity through modern, Yiddish literature. In Lviv, a small neo-romantic author group around the lyricist Schmuel Jankev Imber. Small print offices produced collections of modern poems and short stories. Through emigration and a large network was established.
A second, smaller group tried in the 1930's to create a connection between avantgarde art and Yiddish culture. Members of this group were Debora Vogel, Rachel Auerbach and Rachel Korn. The Shoah destroyed this movement violently. Debora Vogel was, amongst many other Yiddish authors, murdered by the Nazis in the 1940's.
Sports.
Lviv was an important centre for sport in Central Europe and it is regarded as the cradle of Polish football. First known official goal in a football match in Poland was scored there on July 14, 1894, during the Lviv - Krakow game. The goal was scored by Wlodzimierz Chomicki, who represented the team of Lviv. Also, Kazimierz Hemerling from Lviv published in 1904 first rules of football translated into Polish, another person from Lviv, Stanislaw Polakiewicz, became in 1911 first officially recognised Polish referee. In 1911 in Lviv first Polish Football Federation was founded.
The first Polish professional football club, Czarni Lwów, opened in 1903 and the first stadium, which belonged to Pogon, in 1913. Another Lviv's side, Pogon Lwow, was four times football champion of Poland (1922, 1923, 1925 and 1926). In late 1920s, as many as four teams from Lviv played in the Polish Football League (Pogon, Czarni, Hasmonea and Lechia). Several notable figures of Polish football come from this city, including Kazimierz Gorski, Ryszard Koncewicz, Michal Matyas and Waclaw Kuchar.
Lviv also is the Polish cradle of other sports. In January of 1905 first Polish ice-hockey match took place there, two years later first ski-jumping competition was organized in nearby Slawsko, in the same year first Polish basketball games were organized in Lviv's gymnasiums. Several years earlier, in the fall of 1887, in a gym hall by Lyczakowska Street, first Polish track and field competition took place, with such sports as long jump and high jump. Lviv's athlete Wladyslaw Ponurski represented Austria in the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm. Furthermore, on July 9, 1922, first official rugby game in Poland took place at the stadium of Pogon Lwow, in which the rugby team of Orzel Bialy Lwow divided itself into two teams - "The Reds" and "The Blacks". Referee of this game was a Frenchman by the name of Robineau.
Lviv now has several major professional football clubs and some smaller clubs. FC Karpaty Lviv, founded in 1963, plays in the first division of Ukrainian Premier League. Sometimes, the youth of Lviv assemble on the central street (Freedom Avenue) to watch and cheer an outdoor broadcast of a game.
Lviv's Ukraina Stadium is to be renovated and will host three group matches during EURO 2012.
Economy.
Lviv is one of the largest cities in Ukraine and is growing rapidly. It typifies a post-Soviet era developing city. It has problems with infrastructure and pollution, including heavy downtown car pollution on weekdays, some local corruption and irregularities in water supply (especially hot water).
According to the Ministry of Economy of Ukraine, the average salary in the Lviv Oblast is a little less than the average for Ukraine, which, in September 2006, was about 1000 UAH or roughly 200 USD.
In 2006, Ukraine's economic freedom was rated at 3.24, where a rating 1.0 is "freer" than a rating 5.0. According to the World Bank classification, Lviv is a lower middle-income city.
There are many street vendors of food, books, clothes, traditional cultural items and tourist gifts. There are many restaurants and shops, some of which sell expensive western-made goods.
In an interesting mixture of the past and present, peasants from the countryside sell their goods beside a cellphone shop in a medieval building.
Banking and money trading are an important part of the economy, with many banks and exchange offices throughout the city.
Education.
Lviv is an important education centre of Ukraine. It is home to three major universities and a number of smaller schools of higher education. There are eight institutes of the National Academy of Science of Ukraine, more than forty research institutes, three academies and eleven state-owned colleges.
